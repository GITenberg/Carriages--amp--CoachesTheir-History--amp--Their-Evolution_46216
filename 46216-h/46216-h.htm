<h2 style="text-align: left;"><i>Preface</i></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> AM not a coachbuilder. Though such a pronouncement
will seem entirely superfluous to any
coachbuilder who reads the following pages, it is
not perhaps a wholly unnecessary remark. For,
with one or two exceptions, such books upon the evolution
or structure of vehicles as have been written have
been the work of industrious coachbuilders. And I have
not the least doubt that they are eminently the fit and
proper folk to carry out any such task. It is a melancholy
fact, however, that useful though these books may be to
coachbuilders, they lack, again with one or two exceptions,
any general interest to the layman. The language in
which they are written is, to say the least, peculiar, and
the authors have obviously had small training in the art
of book-making. On the other hand, there is a whole
library of books dealing with the old stage and mail
coaches, with all the romance and adventure of the roads,
packed with delightful anecdotes and personal reminiscences.
But such books hardly touch upon the structure
of the coaches themselves, and, so far as I know, there is
no book entirely devoted to a non-technical description
of carriages in general, based upon a chronological arrangement.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to such a book is Mr. G. A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Thrupp’s <i>The History of Coaches</i>, published in 1877,
a meritorious undertaking from which I have freely
quoted. Here, however, there are numerous gaps which
I have endeavoured to fill, and the various lectures from
which it was composed do not fit together so aptly as
might be. As a whole, it is diffuse. Sir Walter Gilbey’s
two books, <i>Early Carriages and Roads</i> and <i>Modern
Carriages</i>, have also been of great assistance, but here,
too, the ground covered is not so large as in the following
pages. Other pamphlets and small books have appeared
in this country, but seemingly owe a great deal of their
information to Mr. Thrupp’s work. Indeed, I notice
that some of the authors have been almost criminally
forgetful of their inverted commas. For purely technical
details there are, of course, many books and trade papers
to consult; but with these I have not been concerned.</p>

<p>In the present book there are, indeed, large gaps, and
it is not to be taken either as a manual of the art of
coach-building or as a history of locomotion. It is merely
a book about carriages, in which particular regard has been
paid to chronological sequence, and particular attention
to such individual carriages as have at all withstood the
test of social history. And it is written by a layman who,
until he enquired into the subject, had never looked at
a carriage with any particular emotion. The result of
his labours, therefore, is not meant for the expert, but
for the general reader, who may have pondered over
the various vehicles he has seen, and idly wondered
how they may have been evolved.</p>

<p>Where possible, I have endeavoured to quote from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
contemporary authors and documents. Most of such
quotations are now included in a carriage book for the
first time.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the various publishers and authors
who have given me permission to reprint illustrations of
carriages in books published or written by them. Also
I am obliged to Messrs. Maggs Bros., the well-known
booksellers, for permission to photograph a rare print
entitled <i>The Carriage Match</i>, in their possession.</p>

<p><i>THE PRIMITIVE VEHICLE</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container2">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“This is a traveller, sir, knows men and</div>
<div class="line">Manners, and has plough’d up sea so far,</div>
<div class="line">Till both the poles have knock’d; has seen the sun</div>
<div class="line">Take coach, and can distinguish the colour</div>

<div class="line i10"><i>Beaumont and Fletcher.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has been suggested that although in a generality
of cases nature has forestalled the ingenious
mechanician, man for his wheel has had to evolve
an apparatus which has no counterpart in his
primitive environment&mdash;in other words, that there is
nothing in nature which corresponds to the <i>wheel</i>.
Yet even the most superficial inquiry into the nature
of the earliest vehicles must do much to refute such a
suggestion. Primitive wheels were simply thick logs
cut from a tree-trunk, probably for firewood. At some
time or another these logs must have rolled of their
own accord from a higher to a lower piece of ground,
and from man’s observation of this simple phenomenon
must have come the first idea of a wheel. If a round
object could roll of its own accord, it could also be
made to roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>Yet it is to be noticed that the earliest methods of
locomotion, other than those purely muscular, such as
walking and riding, knew nothing of wheels. Such
methods depended primarily upon the enormously
significant discovery that a man could drag a heavier
weight than he could carry, and what applied to a man
also applied to a beast. Possibly such discovery followed
on the mere observation of objects being carried
down the stream of some river, and perhaps a rudely
constructed raft should be considered to be the earliest
form of vehicle. From the raft proper to a raft to be
used upon land was but a step, and the first land
vehicle, whenever or wherever it was made, assuredly
took a form which to this day is in common use in
some countries. This was the sledge. On a sledge
heavy loads could be dragged over the ground, and
experience sooner or later must have shown what was
the best form of apparatus for such work. As so often
happens, moreover, in mechanical contrivances, the
earliest sledge of which there is record&mdash;a sculptured
representation in an Egyptian temple&mdash;bears a remarkable
resemblance to those in use at the present time.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Then, as now, men used two long runners with upturned
ends in front and cross-pieces to unite them
and bear the load. Such sledges were largely used to
convey the huge stones with which the Egyptians raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>their solemn masses of masonry and, incidentally, also
as a hearse. In time, however, it was found that better
results were obtained by the use of another and rather
more complicated apparatus which had for its chief component&mdash;a
wheel. This second discovery that to roll
a burden proved an easier task than to drag it was
fraught with such tremendous consequences as altered
the entire history of the world.</p>

<p>It remained to find a better fulcrum than that afforded
by the rough turf over which such logs, when burdened,
were rolled. What probably followed is well described
by Bridges Adams.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> “The next process,” he thinks,
“would naturally be that of cutting a hole through the
roller in which to insert the lever. The convenience of
several holes in the circumference of the roller would
then become apparent, and there would be formed an
embryo wheel nave. It could not fail to be remarked
also, that the larger the roller, the greater the facility
for turning it, and consequently the greater the load
that could be borne upon it.” Owing to the difficulty
of using such large logs, he goes on to suggest, a time
would come when it was found that a roller need not
bear upon the ground throughout its length, but only
at its extremities. So from the single roller would be
evolved two rough wheels joined by a beam, square at
first though afterwards rounded, upon which could be
fixed a frame for the load.</p>

<p>Such axle and wheels would revolve together and
keep the required position by means of pieces of wood
which may be compared with the thole-pins of a boat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>And it is a remarkable fact that until last century such
primitive carts were in use in Portugal and parts of
South America. The chief drawback to a vehicle of
this kind is its inability to turn in a small space, and
the pioneers, whoever they were, finally discovered the
principle of the fixed axle-tree, the wheels revolving
upon their own centre. So, “instead of fixing the
cross-beam or axle in a square hole,” these pioneers
“would contrive it to play easily in a round one of a
conical form, that being the easiest form of adjustment.”
Such a car as this, with solid wheels and a rude frame,
was used by the Romans, and is still to be seen in parts
of Chili. The next process in the evolution of the
wheel doubtless followed upon the necessity of economising
with large sections of wood, and there was
finally invented a wheel made of three portions&mdash;a
central pierced part, the nave, an outside circular piece,
the rim or felloe, and two or more cross-pieces, joining
the two, the spokes. Of these the felloes would tend
to wear soonest, and a double set would be applied to
the spokes, as was the case until recently in the ox-carts
of the Pampas, or <i>barcos de tierra</i>, as they were called by
the natives.</p>

<p>And indeed, the first carriages of which we have
particular information, the chariots of the Egyptians
and their neighbours, differ essentially from such primitive
carts only in the delicacy and ornamentation of the
carriage body.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Types of Primitive Carts</i></p></div>

<p>Various vehicles are mentioned in the Bible, though
one must be chary of differentiating between them
merely because the translators have given them different
names. Both waggons and chariots are mentioned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>Genesis. Jacob’s family were sent to him in a waggon.
Joseph rode in the second chariot of Pharaoh as a particular
mark of favour. At the time of the Exodus,
war-chariots formed an important part of the Egyptian
army, and indeed, right through the various dynasties,
there is an almost continuous mention of their use.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
“The deft craftsmen of Egypt,” says Breasted,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> “soon
mastered the art of chariot-making, and the stables of
the Pharaoh contained thousands of the best horses to be
had in Asia.” About 1500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Thutmose III went forth to
battle in “a glittering chariot of electrum.” He slew
the enemy’s leader, and took captive their princes and
“their chariots, wrought with gold, bound to their
horses.” These barbarians also had “chariots of silver,”
though this probably means that they were built of wood
and strengthened or decorated with silver. At the dissolution
of the Empire the Hittites had increased
wonderfully in power, and it is told of them that they
excelled all other nations in the art of chariotry. The
Hittite chariot was larger and more heavily built than
that of the Egyptians, as it bore three men, driver, bowman,
and shield-bearer, while the Egyptian was satisfied
with two. The enormous number of chariots used in
warfare is shown by the fact that in the fourteenth
century before Christ, when the Egyptians defeated the
Syrians at Megiddo, nearly a thousand were captured,
and against Ramses II the Hittites put no less than
2500 into the field.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“The Egyptian chariots,” says H. A. White,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “were
of light and simple construction, the material employed
being wood, as is proved by sculptures representing the
manufacture of chariots. The axle was set far back, and
the bottom of the car, which rested on this and on the
pole, was sometimes formed of a frame interlaced with
a network of thongs or ropes. The chariot was entirely
open behind and for the greater part of the sides, which
were formed by a curved rail rising from each side of
the back of the base, and resting on a wooden upright
above the pole in front. From this rail, which was
strengthened by leather thongs, a bow-case of leather,
often richly ornamented, hung on the right-hand side,
slanting forwards; while the quiver and spear cases
inclined in the opposite direction. The wheels, which
were fastened on the axle by a linch-pin secured with a
short thong, had six spokes in the case of war chariots,
but in private vehicles sometimes only four.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The
pole sloped upwards, and to the end of it a curved yoke
was attached. A small saddle at each end of the yoke
rested on the withers of the horses, and was secured in
its place by breast-band and girth. No traces are to be
seen. The bridle was often ornamented; a bearing-rein
was fastened to the saddle, and the other reins passed
through a ring at the side of this. The number of
horses to a chariot seems always to have been two; and
in the car, which contained no seat, only rarely are more
than two persons depicted, except in triumphal processions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="500" height="457" alt="Assyrian Chariot" />
<p class="caption"><i>Assyrian Chariot</i><br />(<i>From Smith’s “Concise History of English Carriages”</i>)</p></div>

<p>“Assyrian chariots did not differ in any essential points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>from the Egyptian.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> They were, however, completely
panelled at the sides, and a shield was sometimes
hung at the back. The wheels had six, or, at a later
period, eight spokes; the felloes were broad, and seem
to have been formed of three distinct circles of wood,
sometimes surrounded by a metal tyre. While only two
horses were attached to the yokes, in the older monuments
a third horse is generally to be seen, which was
probably used as a reserve. The later chariots are
square in front, not rounded; the car itself is larger
and higher; the cases for the weapons are placed in
front, not at the side; and only two horses are used.
The harness differs somewhat from the Egyptian. A
broad collar passes round the neck, from which hangs a
breast ornament, the whole being secured by a triple
strap under the belly of the horse. As in Egypt there
are no traces visible; two driving-reins are attached to
each horse, but the bearing-rein seems to be unknown.
In addition to the warrior and the charioteer, we often
see a third man who bears a shield; and a fourth occupant
of the chariot sometimes appears.</p>

<p>“The Hittite chariots, as represented on Egyptian
monuments, regularly contain three warriors. In construction
they are plainer and more solid than the
Egyptian, and the sides are not open. The chariots on
Persian sculptures closely resemble the Assyrian.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There is still preserved in the Archæological Museum
at Florence an Egyptian chariot, a light, simple, two-wheeled
affair with a single shaft and four spokes to
the wheels. From the number of spokes it may be
supposed that this particular chariot was not used in
war. In New York, too, there is preserved the wheel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>of an Egyptian chariot found at Dashour. The particulars
of this bear out Mr. White’s description. The
wheel itself is three feet high, with a long axle arm, six
spokes, tapering towards the felloe, and a double rim.
“The six inner felloes do not meet as in modern
wheels,” says Thrupp,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> “but are spliced one over the
other, with an overlap of three inches.”</p>

<p>Artificial roads seem to have existed at an early
period in Palestine, but the country was hardly suitable
for vehicles, and one first hears of waggons in the flatter
wastes of Egypt and the level plains of Philistia.
Agricultural carts these were, though no doubt early
used for passenger traffic. Some of these carts were
most probably covered, though no coverings seem to
have been fixed to the chariots. The Assyrians, however,
occasionally took into their private chariots an
attendant, who was provided with a covering shaped
somewhat like a modern umbrella. This covering was
held over the owner’s head, and was sometimes provided
with a curtain which hung down at the back.</p>

<p>Details of the private carriages in use during these
Biblical times filter through the chronicles. In Syria
the merchants despatched by Solomon to buy chariots
had to pay 600 shekels each for them. Solomon in his
quest for luxury seems to have been the first man to
build a more elaborate car than satisfied his contemporaries.
One to be used on state occasions was built of
cedar wood and had “pillars of gold.” Probably it was
some form of litter. The number of private cars was
increasing enormously in all these Eastern cities. The
prophet Nahum in lamenting the future woes of Nineveh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>speaks of “the noise of the whip, and the noise of the
rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and
of the jumping chariots,” which will no longer bear witness
to the city’s prosperity. The absence of wide roads,
however, militated against great changes of form in the
carriages, which maintained their simple shape until
many centuries later.</p>

<p class="tb">The war-chariot (ἄρμα or δίφρος) of the early Greeks
was curved in front, and loftier than that of the
Egyptians. The entrance was at the back. It was never
covered, but frequently bore a curious basket-like arrangement,
the πείρινς, upon or in which two people
could sit. The ἄντυξ, or rim, in most cases ran round the
three sides of the body, but occasionally there was only
a curved barrier in front. The body itself was often
strengthened by a trellis-work of strips of light wood or
metal. The barrier was of varying height; in some
chariots it did not reach above the driver’s knee; in
others it came up to his waist, but in war-chariots never
higher than that. The axle was of oak, ash, elm, or
even of iron, and precious metals, according to the
legend, were used for the chariots of the gods. So of
Juno’s car we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“The whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.</div>
<div class="line">On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel</div>
<div class="line">Of sounding brass: the polish’d axle steel.</div>
<div class="line">Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;</div>
<div class="line">The circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,</div>
<div class="line">Such as the heavens produce; and round the gold</div>
<div class="line">Two brazen rings of work divine were roll’d.</div>
<div class="line">The bossy naves of solid silver shone;</div>
<div class="line">Braces of gold suspend the moving throne.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last line suggests an innovation which was certainly
not followed for some considerable time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>The chariot in general was about seven feet long, and
could be lifted by a strong man like Diomed. Indeed,
it could be driven over the bodies of dead warriors.
The pole sloped sharply upwards, and sometimes ended
in the head of a bird or animal. It emerged either
from the floor of the car or from the axle. Towards its
end the yoke for the horses was fastened about a pin
fixed into it. Though the Lydians used chariots with
two or even three poles, the Greeks never had more
than one; and as with the Egyptians, there were no
traces. If the pole broke, the horses must have dashed
away with part of it, leaving the chariot at a standstill.
Occasionally, too, a third horse was used, upon which
sat a postilion.</p>

<p>At a later period several Grecian carriages were in
common use, though not in warfare. Representations
of such cars are to be found on the Elgin Marbles.
And, as was the case a dozen or more centuries afterwards,
the carriage became the outward sign of luxury.
It invariably appeared in the state processions, and was
made the receptacle for the most gorgeous ornamentation.
Gold, ebony, copper, ivory, and white lead were
all used for this purpose, while the interiors of the cars
were made comfortable with soft cushions and fine
tapestries. They appeared, too, in great numbers at the
famous chariot races, at which four or more horses were
driven abreast. Often the same man was rich enough
to possess more than one carriage. So we read of
Xerxes changing from his ἄρμα to his ἁρμάμαξα, or state-carriage,
at the end of a march. Besides these, there
were also the ἀπήνη, a kind of family sociable, the ἅμαξα,
a waggon, the κάναθρον, and the φορεῖον, or litter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The  ἁρμάμαξα was a large four-wheeled waggon,
enclosed by curtains and provided with a καμάρα or
roof. Four or more horses were required to draw it.
It was so large that a person could lie in it at full
length, and, indeed, on many occasions it acted the part
of a hearse. By far the most extraordinary hearse ever
built was a ἁρμάμαξα used to convey the body of
Alexander the Great&mdash;himself the possessor of numerous
carriages&mdash;from Babylon to Alexandria.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was prepared,” says Thrupp, “during two years,
and was designed by the celebrated architect and
engineer Hieronymus. It was 18 feet long and
12 feet wide, on four massive wheels, and drawn
by sixty-four mules, eight abreast. The car was composed
of a platform with a lofty roof supported by
eighteen columns, and was profusely adorned with
drapery and gold and jewels; round the edge of the
roof was a row of golden bells; in the centre was a
throne, and before it the coffin; around were placed
the weapons of war and the arms that Alexander had
used.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The ἁρμάμαξα was also largely used by the ladies of
Greece, who when they drove forth were careful to
see that the curtains completely enclosed them. The
ἅμαξα, also a four-wheeled waggon, was probably similar
to the ἁρμάμαξα, though built upon a less imposing scale.
The ἀπήνη was a still lighter carriage. It is described
by Herodotus, and seems to have been a covered vehicle
surrounded by silken curtains which could be pulled
back when required. Its interior was generally furnished
with cushions of goat leather. Two wheels were
more frequent, but four were sometimes found. It was
said that Timoleon, an old blind man, drove upon one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
occasion into the senate house and delivered a speech
from his ἀπήνη. In some cases a two-wheeled carriage
of this kind was not furnished with curtains, but
enclosed in an oval-shaped covering of basket-work.
Hesiod objected to such a conveyance because of its
inability to keep out the dust. Little is known of the
κάναθρον, but it was a Laconian car made of wood, with
an arched, plaited covering, used chiefly by women.
Doubtless it was little different from the ἀπήνη.</p>

<p>Coming to the Romans, we find a far greater variety
of vehicles, though the descriptions that have come down
are meagre and not particularly distinctive. That the
Romans early realised the enormous importance, both
military and otherwise, of carriages, is shown by their
amazing roads. Such roads had never before been constructed.
They were, says Gibbon, “accurately divided
by milestones, and ran in a direct line from one city to
another, with very little respect for the obstacles, either
of nature or private property. Mountains were perforated,
and bold arches thrown over the broadest and
most rapid streams. The middle part of the road was
raised into a terrace, which commanded the adjacent
country, consisted of several layers of sand, gravel,
and cement, and was paved with large stones, or, in
some places near the capital, with granite.” Probably
the most famous of these roads was the Appian Way,
connecting Rome with Capua. It was wide enough,
according to Procopius, who marched along it in the
sixth century, for two chariots to pass one another
without inconvenience or delay, a matter certainly not
possible, for instance, in most of the Eastern cities at
that time. And so, with the finest engineers the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
had seen linking up various cities, cross-country travelling
in a carriage, from being well-nigh impossible, became
comparatively easy. Gibbon mentions in this connection
the surprising feat of one Cæsarius, who journeyed
from Antioch to Constantinople, a distance of 665 miles,
in six days.</p>

<p>The Roman war-chariot, or <i>currus</i>, was practically the
same as the Greek ἄρμα, though certain modifications
were introduced. More than two horses were driven,
and from their number came several words, such as
<i>sejugis</i>, <i>octojugis</i>, and <i>decemjugis</i>, which sufficiently explain
themselves. It appears, moreover, that the <i>currus</i> was
occasionally driven by four horses without either pole
or yoke, and it has been suggested that in such a case
the driver probably stopped the car by bearing all his
weight on to the back of the body, so that its floor
would touch the ground, thus forming a primitive brake.
Besides the <i>currus</i>, and even before their marvellous
roads had been laid down, the Romans possessed other
cars. The earliest of these seems to have been a long,
covered, four-wheeled waggon, called <i>arcera</i>, which was
mainly used to carry infirm or very old people. In this
the driver sat on a seat in front of the body, and drove
two horses abreast. Though the most ancient of the
Roman carriages, the <i>arcera</i>, as seen on monuments, has
a very modern appearance. In more luxurious times
the <i>lectica</i>, a large litter, seems to have led to its gradual
extinction.</p>

<p>The <i>essedum</i>, at one time very popular in Italy, was
brought in the first place to Rome by Julius Cæsar. It
was the war-chariot of the Britons, and was entirely
unlike the Roman or Egyptian cars. The wheels were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
much larger, the entrance was in front and not at the
back, there was a seat, and the pole, instead of running
up to the horses’ necks, remained horizontal, and was
so wide that the driver could step along it. The British
charioteers could drive their cars at a very great rate,
and were exceedingly agile on the flat pole, from the
extremity of which they threw their missiles. The cars
were purposely made as noisy as possible to strike dismay
into the enemy’s lines. At times the wheels were furnished
with scythes, which projected from the axle-tree
ends, and helped to maim those unfortunate enough to
be run down.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Cicero, hearing good opinions of it,
besought a friend to bring him a good pattern from
Britain, and took occasion to add that the chariot was
the only pleasing thing which that benighted country
produced. The <i>essedum</i> speedily became popular in
Rome, though not as an engine of war. Decorated
and constructed of fine materials, it was the fashionable
pleasure carriage. Curiously enough, however, the seat
which had been so conspicuous a feature of the chariot
in its native place was not used in Rome. The owner
drove the <i>essedum</i> himself, and yoked two horses to the
pole. There was some opposition to its use on the
grounds of undue luxury, and a tribune who rode
abroad in one was on that account considered effeminate.
Seneca put the <i>esseda deaurata</i> amongst things <i>quæ matronarum
usibus necessaria sint</i>. Emperors and generals
used them as travelling carriages, and they were to be
hired at regular posting-stations. A somewhat similar
carriage, the <i>covinus</i>, was also in use in various countries
at this date. This was covered in except in front; like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>the <i>essedum</i>, it had no seat for the driver, and in times
of war it seems to have had scythes attached to the
axle in the British fashion. Little, however, is known
of it, and it may be dismissed here with a mere mention
of its existence.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Agrippina’s Carpentum</i><br />(<i>From a Roman Coin</i>)</p></div>

<p>The <i>essedum</i> is of particular importance insomuch as
it may be considered to be the prototype of all the
vehicles of the curricle or gig type. The first of these
in use amongst the Romans was the <i>cisium</i>, whose form is
well shown on a monumental column near Treves. It
was surprisingly like the ordinary gig of modern times.
The body at first was fixed to the frames, but afterwards
seems to have been suspended by rough traces or straps.
The entrance was in front, there was a seat for two, and
underneath this a large box or case. Mules were generally
used to draw it, one, a pair, or, according to
Ausonius, three&mdash;in which case a postilion sat on the
third horse. They were built primarily for speed, and
were in common use throughout Italy and Gaul, though
the ladies, unwilling to be seen in an uncovered carriage,
drove in other conveyances. The <i>cisium</i> on the
whole must have been comfortable and light. Seneca
admits that you could write a letter easily while driving
in one. And in due course the new carriage became so
popular that it could be hired, and the <i>cisiarii</i>, or hackney
coachmen, could be penalised for careless driving.
Indeed, so very modern were the Roman ideas upon the
question of travel, that there were certain places at
which the <i>cisium</i> was always to be found&mdash;a kind of
primitive cab-rank.</p>

<p>Coming to the larger waggons and carriages, there
were the <i>sarracum</i>, the <i>plaustrum</i>, the <i>carpentum</i>, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span><i>pilentum</i>,
the <i>benna</i>, the <i>reda</i>, the <i>carruca</i>, the <i>pegma</i>&mdash;a huge
wheeled apparatus used for raising great weights, particularly
in theatrical displays&mdash;and a mule-drawn litter,
the <i>basterna</i>. Of these the <i>sarracum</i> was a common cart
used by the country folk for conveying produce. It had
either two or four wheels, and was occasionally used by
passengers, though, as Cicero observed, as a conveyance
the <i>sarracum</i> was very vulgar. It was not confined to
Italy, but was common enough amongst those barbaric
tribes against whom Rome was so often victorious. It
was in <i>sarraca</i>, moreover, that the bodies were removed
from Rome in times of plague. Rather lighter than
this carriage, though heavy enough to our modern
ideas, was the <i>plaustrum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> an ancient two or four-wheeled
waggon of rude construction. This was, in its primitive
form, just a bare platform with a large pole projecting
from the axle; there were no supporting ribs at all, and
the load was simply placed on the platform. Upright
boards, or openwork rails, however, were used to make
sides, and at a later period a large basket was fastened
on to the platform by stout thongs. The wheels of the
<i>plaustrum</i> were ordinarily solid, of a kind called <i>tympana</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>or drums, and were nearly a foot thick. Such a cart
was but a slow vehicle, and could turn only with great
difficulty. It was drawn by oxen or mules, and like the
<i>sarracum</i> was also used to carry passengers.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p class="caption"><i>Benna</i></p></div>

<p>The <i>carpentum</i>, though two-wheeled, bore resemblance
to the Greek ἁρμάμαξα. It had an arched covering. It
was in use during very early times at Rome, though
only distinguished citizens were privileged to ride in it.
The <i>currus arcuatus</i>, given by Numa to the Flamines, was
no doubt a form of <i>carpentum</i>, which was also the travelling
carriage of the elder Tarquin. It seems to have
been evolved from the <i>plaustrum</i>, being originally little
more than a covered cart; but in the days of the
Empire it became most luxurious, and was not only
furnished with curtains of the richest silk, but seems to
have had solid panellings and sculptures attached to the
body. Agrippina’s <i>carpentum</i>, for instance, had fine
paintings on its panels, and its roof was supported by
figures at the four corners. Like the ἁρμάμαξα, it was
also used as a hearse. Two mules were required to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>draw it. The <i>pilentum</i> was a carriage of a more official
character. It may be called the state coach of the
Romans&mdash;a four-wheeled becushioned car with a roof
supported by pillars, but, unlike the <i>carpentum</i>, open
at the sides. It was always considered to be the most
comfortable of the Roman carriages, and may indeed
have been hung upon “swing-poles” between the
wheels. The social difference between the <i>pilentum</i> and
the <i>carpentum</i> may be deduced from one of the many
carriage laws passed by the Senate. The Roman matrons
were allowed to drive in the <i>carpentum</i> on all occasions,
but might use the <i>pilentum</i> only at the games or
public festivals. Such “sumptuary laws” were constantly
being passed, and a special vote was even required
to enable the mother of Nero to drive in her carriage in
the city itself. It was not until the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
that all such restrictions were banished.</p>

<p>Pliny mentions another carriage of imperial Rome&mdash;the
<i>carruca</i>, which had four wheels and was used
equally in the city and for long journeys. Nero travelled
with great numbers of them&mdash;on one occasion with no
less than three thousand. In Rome itself the fashionable
citizen drove forth in a <i>carruca</i> that was covered
with plates of bronze, silver, or even gold. Enormous
sums were spent upon their decoration. Painters, sculptors,
and embroiderers were employed. Martial speaks
of an <i>aurea carruca</i> costing as much as a large farm. The
<i>carruca</i>, indeed, may be said to correspond with the
phaeton, which was so fashionable in England towards
the end of the eighteenth century. As with the phaeton,
so with the <i>carruca</i>&mdash;the higher it was built the better
pleased was its owner. Various kinds of <i>carruca</i> existed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
The <i>carrucæ argentatæ</i> were those granted by Alexander
Severus to the senators. There is also mention of a
<i>carruca domestoria</i>. Unfortunately, however, no contemporary
representation of a carriage can definitely be said
to be a <i>carruca</i>. Little enough, moreover, is known of
the two other waggons, the <i>reda</i> and the <i>benna</i>. The <i>reda</i>
was a large four-wheeled waggon used mainly to convey
agricultural produce. It seems to have been brought
into Italy from Wallachia. The <i>benna</i> was a cart whose
body was formed entirely of basket-work. There is a
drawing of it on the column of Antoninus at Rome. A
similar vehicle persists to this day in Italy, South Germany,
and Belgium, and bears a similar name.</p>

<p>Under the Empire, then, carriage-building flourished,
particularly after Alexander Severus had put an end
to all the older restrictions. Various forms of
carriages were to be seen on the roads, and there was,
as I have hinted, even an attempt at a spring. One of
the carriages of this period is definitely described as
“borne on long poles, fixed to the axles.” “Now a
certain amount of spring,” says Thrupp, “can be obtained
from the centre of a long, light pole. The
Neapolitan Calesse, the Norwegian Carriole, and the
Yarmouth Cart were all made with a view to obtaining
ease by suspension on poles between bearings placed far
apart. In these the seat is placed midway between the
two wheels and the horse, on very long shafts, which
are there made into wooden springs.” And in the old
Roman carriages, he goes on to say, “the weight was
carried between the front and hind axles, on long poles
or wooden springs. The undercarriage of the later
four-wheeled vehicles used by the Romans was, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
probability, the same as is in use at the present day,
both in this country and on the Continent, and indeed
in America, for the under-carriages of agricultural waggons.”
Even with such splendid roads as the Romans
possessed, however, the streets of their towns do not
seem to have been very wide, and this must be one of
the reasons for the early appearance of another kind
of conveyance, the litter, which, during the dark ages,
was practically the only carriage to be used.</p>

<p>These litters came from the East. The Babylonians
in particular preferred to be carried about in a chair or
couch rather than to be jolted in a carriage. Ericthonius,
a lame man, is supposed to have introduced
them into Athens, where they were known as φορεῖα or
σκιμπόδια. Speedily they became popular, especially
with the women. Magnificently decorated, the φορεῖον
was constantly carried along the narrow streets, and on
being brought over to Rome proved no less agreeable
to the Romans. The <i>lectica</i>, or, as it was called at a
later period, the <i>sella</i>, may in the first instance have
been used to carry the sick, but in a short time became
a common form of conveyance. This palanquin had an
arched roof of leather stretched over four posts. The
sides were covered by curtains, though at a later period
it would seem that crude windows of talc were used.
The interior was furnished with pillows, and when standing
the litter rested upon four feet. Two slaves bore
it by means of long poles loosely attached. In Martial’s
time these <i>lecticarii</i> wore red liveries, and were sometimes
preceded by a third slave to make way. Julius Cæsar
restricted their numbers, and in the reign of Claudius
permission to use them was granted only as a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
mark of the royal favour. Several varieties of litter
appeared. The <i>sella portatoria</i> or <i>gestatoria</i> was a small
sedan chair. Some, however, were constructed to hold
two. The <i>cathedra</i>, which was probably identical with
the <i>sella muliebris</i> mentioned by Suetonius, was mostly
used by women. The <i>basterna</i> was a much larger litter,
also used by women under the Empire, which was
carried by two mules. In this carriage the sides might
be opened or closed, and the whole body was frequently
gilded.</p>

<p class="tb">A few other primitive carriages here call for mention.
The Dacians, who inhabited parts of what is now
Hungary, used square vehicles with four wheels, in
which the six spokes widened towards the rims. The
Scythians used a peculiar two-wheeled cart consisting of
a platform on which was placed a conical covering,
resembling in shape a beehive, and made of a basket-work
of hazelwood, over which were stretched the skins
of beasts or a thatching of reeds. When camping out
these people would lift this covering bodily from the
cart and use it as a tent. Much the same custom was
followed by the wandering Tartars. “Their huts or
tents,” says Marco Polo, “are formed of rods covered
with felt, and being exactly round and nicely put
together, they can gather them into one bundle, and
make them up as packages, which they carry along with
them in their migrations, upon a sort of car with four
wheels.” “Besides these cars,” he continues, “they
have a superior kind of vehicle upon two wheels,
covered likewise with black felt, and so effectually as
to protect those within it from wet during a whole day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of rain. These are drawn by oxen and camels, and
serve to convey their wives and children, their utensils,
and such provisions as they require.” The same
traveller described the carriages of Southern China.
Speaking of Kin-sai, then the capital, he says, “The
main street of the city ... is paved with stone and
brick to the width of ten paces on each side, the intermediate
part being filled up with small gravel, and
provided with arched drains for carrying off the rain-water
that falls into the neighbouring canals, so that it
remains always dry. On this gravel it is that the
carriages are continually passing and re-passing. They
are of a long shape, covered at top, having curtains and
cushions of silk, and are capable of holding six persons.
Both men and women who feel disposed to take their
pleasure are in the daily practice of hiring them for that
purpose, and accordingly at every hour you may see
vast numbers of them driven along the middle part
of the street.” To this day such carriages as are here
described can be had for hire in China, though in
general they are of a smaller size. In some respects
they resembled what is called in this country a tilted
cart.</p>

<p>The Persians used large chariots in which was built
a kind of turret from whose interior the warriors could
at once throw their spears and obtain protection. One,
taken from an ancient coin, is thus described by Sir
Robert Ker Porter in his <i>Travels in Georgia, Persia, and
Ancient Babylon</i> (1821):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>” ... a large chariot, which is drawn by a magnificent
pair of horses; one of the men, in ampler garments
than his compeers, and bareheaded, holds the bridle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>of the horses ... [which] are without trappings, but
the details of their bits and the manner of reining them
are executed with the utmost care. The pole of the
car is seen passing behind the horses, projecting from
the centre of the carriage, which is in a cylindrical shape,
elevated rather above the line of the animals’ heads.
The wheel of the car is extremely light and tastefully
put together.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, too, it is to be noticed that the driver is shown
with his arms over the backs of the animals. In another
chariot, which most probably was Persian, the body
seems to be made of a “light wood, as of interlaced
canes. Similar chariots are seen in the Assyrian bas-reliefs
and others, somewhat resembling this, on
Etruscan and Grecian painted vases. A chariot thus
constituted must have been of extreme rapidity and
of scarcely any weight.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The Persians also had an idol-car, which was a kind
of moving platform, and their chariots were at one
period armed with scythes. These scythes, generally
considered to be the invention of Cyrus, do not seem
to have hung from the axle-ends, as was the case in
Britain, but from the body itself, “in order,” thinks
Ginzrot, who wrote on these early carriages, “to allow
the wheels to turn unobstructed. In this way,” he says,
“the scythes had a firm hold, and could inflict more
damage than if they had been applied to the wheels
or felloes and revolved with them. Nearly all writers
treating on this subject are of this opinion, and Curtius
says: <i>Alias deinde falces summis rotarum orbibus hærebant</i>
[thence curving downwards]. The scythes could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>easily have been attached to the body ... and, notwithstanding,
it might be said they extended over the
felloe, for Curtius said, not that the scythes revolved
with the wheels, but <i>hærebant</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Early Indian carriages were probably not very different
from some of those now in use amongst the natives.
The common <i>gharry</i> is certainly built after a primitive
model. In this there are two wheels, “a high axle-tree
bed, and a long platform, frequently made of two
bamboos, which join in front and form the pole, to
which two oxen are yoked.” In Arabia there was the
<i>araba</i>, a primitive latticed carriage for women, which
possessed “wing-guards”&mdash;pieces of wood shaped to
the top of the wheels and projecting over them&mdash;a
feature also to be found in the early Persian cars.</p>

<p>Taking these early carriages as a whole one may be
inclined to feel surprise at the varieties displayed, yet
there were not after all very great differences between
them. They were two-or four-wheeled contrivances
with a long pole in front, and it is only in mere size
and decoration that discrimination can properly be made.
“The Egyptians,” says Thrupp, “with all their learning
and skill, appear to have made no change during the
centuries of experience; as at the beginning, so at the
end, the kings stand by the side of their charioteers, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>hold the reins themselves. The Persians and Hindoos
introduced luxurious improvements, and in lofty
vehicles elevated the nobles above the heads of the
people, and secluded their women in curtained carriages.
The Greeks introduced no new vehicles, but perfected
so successfully the useful waggon, that their model is
still seen throughout Europe, without change of principle
or structure. The Romans, on the other hand,
in their career of conquest, gathered from every nation
what was good, and, wherever possible, improved upon
it.” After the fall of the Roman Empire, however,
there was little further progress for several centuries.
In the general retrogression, which, rightly or wrongly,
one associates with those dark ages, the wheeled carriage,
in common with a multitude of other adjuncts to civilisation,
was to suffer.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S roadmakers, the Romans, if they can be said to
have had successors at all, were succeeded by
the monks. On the assumption that travellers
were unfortunate people, as indeed they were,
needing help, religious Orders were founded whose chief
work was that of building bridges and repairing the
roads. Other Orders likewise performed such tasks,
though possibly for more selfish reasons, being as they
were large owners of cattle, and immersed as much in
agricultural as in theological occupations. So in many
parts of Europe the <i>Pontife</i> Brothers, or bridge-makers,
were to be found. There were also Gilds formed to
repair the roads, such as the Gild of the Holy Cross
in Birmingham, founded in the reign of Richard II,
which “mainteigned ... and kept in good reparaciouns
the greate stone bridges, and divers foule and dangerous
high wayes, the charge whereof the towne of hitsellfe
ys not hable to mainteigne.” In <i>Piers the Plowman</i>, too,
the rich merchants are exhorted to repair the “wikked
wayes” and see that the “brygges to-broke by the heye
weyes” may be mended “in som manere wise.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
maintenance of the roads in England, says M. Jusserand,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
“greatly depended upon arbitrary chance, upon opportunity,
or on the goodwill or the devotion of those to
whom the adjoining land belonged. In the case of the
roads, as of bridges, we find petitions of private persons
who pray that a tax be levied upon those who pass
along, towards the repair of the road.” So in 1289,
Walter Godelak of Walingford is praying for “the
establishment of a custom to be collected from every
cart of merchandize traversing the road between Jowemarsh
and Newenham, on account of the depth, and for
the repair, of the said way.” Unfortunately for him&mdash;and
doubtless he was no exception to the rule&mdash;the
reply came: “The King will do nothing therein.”</p>

<p>Indeed the roads were in a truly abominable condition.
As often as not, deep ruts marred what surface
there had ever been, and here and there brooks and
pools rendered easy passage an impossibility. There is
a patent of Edward III (Nov. 20, 1353) which ordered
“the paving of the high road, <i>alta via</i>, running from
Temple Bar”&mdash;then the western limit of London&mdash;“to
Westminster.” “This road,” says M. Jusserand, “had
been paved, but the King explains that it is ‘so full of
holes and bogs ... and that the pavement is so
damaged and broken’ that the traffic has become very
dangerous for men and carriages. In consequence, he
orders each proprietor on both sides of the road to
remake, at his own expense, a footway of seven feet up
to the ditch, <i>usque canellum</i>,” and see to it that the
middle of the road is well paved. In France matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>were just as bad. “Outside the town of Paris,” runs
one fourteenth-century ordinance, “in several parts of
the suburbs ... there are many notable and ancient
high-roads, bridges, lanes, and roads, which are much
injured, damaged or decayed and otherwise hindered by
ravines of water and great stones, by hedges, brambles,
and many other trees which have grown there, and by
many other hindrances which have happened there,
because they have not been maintained and provided for
in time past; and they are in such a bad state that they
cannot be securely traversed on foot or horseback, nor
by vehicles, without great perils and inconveniences;
and some of them are abandoned at all parts because
men cannot resort there.” Wherefore it was proposed
that the inhabitants should be compelled, by force if
necessary, to attend to the matter.</p>

<p>While, however, the wretched state into which the roads
were being allowed to fall had a great deal to do with
the almost total, though indeed temporary, extinction of
the wheeled pleasure carriage in western Europe, there
is another fact which must be taken into consideration
in any endeavour to account for it. As will appear in a
little, the renaissance of carriage-building in the sixteenth
century was for a time retarded in various places
by a widespread feeling of distrust against anything that
could be thought to lead to an accusation of effeminacy.
Laws were passed&mdash;as was the case, for instance, in
1294, under Philip the Fair of France&mdash;forbidding
people to ride in coaches, and sharp comparisons were
drawn by the satirists between the hardy horsemen of
old and the modern comfort-loving individuals who
lolled, or were supposed to loll&mdash;though how they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
have done so in those springless monstrosities is past
comprehension&mdash;in their gaudily decorated carriages.
I would not insist upon the point, but it may be that in
the reaction against such undue luxuries as had helped
to bring ruin to the Roman Empire, carriages for that
reason became unpopular. From which, of course, it
would follow that the disappearance of the carriage led,
in part at any rate, to the neglect of the roads, and such
new roads as were made would be laid down primarily
for the convenience only of the horsemen. The same
thing applied also to the litters, though their popularity
naturally followed merely upon the state of the
roads.</p>

<p>Before attempting to deal with these litters, it will be
well to see what is known&mdash;it is not very much&mdash;of
such wheeled carriages as there were at this time, and at
the outset it is necessary to bear in mind that the old
chroniclers used the word <i>carriage</i> in anything but its
modern significance. To them a carriage was no more
than an agricultural or baggage cart. Time and again
you have accounts of this or that great man making his
way, peaceably or otherwise, through some country,
accompanied by numbers of carriages. These were
simply his luggage carts, and although, as in earlier
times, the cart, gaily ornamented, could very easily be
converted into a pleasure carriage, it is important to
remember the real meaning of the word. Such carts,
in point of fact, were extremely common. In England
they were generally square boxes made of planks borne
on two wheels. Others, of a lighter pattern, were built
of “slatts latticed with a willow trellis.” Their chief
peculiarity was to be found in their wheels, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
furnished with extraordinarily large nails with prominent
heads. Contemporary manuscripts give rough
pictures of such carts. One of these is shown drawn
by three dogs. One man squats inside, a second helps
to push it from behind. A most interesting illustration
in the Louterell Psalter&mdash;a fourteenth-century manuscript&mdash;shows
a reaper’s cart going uphill. Here the
two huge, six-spoked wheels with their projecting nails
are clearly shown. The platform of the cart is
strengthened by upright stakes with a cross-rail connecting
them at the sides. The driver, standing over
the wheels on the poles, is holding a long whip which
is flicking the leader of three horses. Three other men
are helping at the rear, and the stacks of wheat are held
in position by ropes.</p>

<p>The earliest Anglo-Saxon carriage of which there is
record belongs to the twelfth century. Strutt refers to
a drawing in one of the Cottonian manuscripts, which
represents a peculiar four-wheeled contrivance with two
upright poles rising from the axle-trees, from which
poles is slung a hammock. Such a chariot or <i>chaer</i>
was apparently used by the more distinguished Anglo-Saxons
when setting out upon long journeys. The
drawing shows the figure of Joseph on his way to meet
Jacob in Egypt, but is no doubt a correct representation
of a travelling carriage in the artist’s lifetime. This
hammock is interesting as being a primitive form of
suspension, which may or may not have led to the later
experiments in that direction.</p>

<p>A most luxurious English carriage of the fourteenth
century is shown in the Louterell Psalter. This was
obviously evolved from a four-wheeled waggon. Five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>horses, harnessed at length, drew it, a postilion with
a short whip riding on the second, and another with a
long whip on the wheeler. The tunnel-like body was
highly ornamented, and its front decorated with carved
birds and men’s heads. The frame of the body was
continued in front as two poles, and underneath, hanging
by a ring and looking rather ludicrous, is shown a
small trunk. Women only appear in this carriage, the
men riding behind it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nothing,” remarks M. Jusserand, “gives a better
idea of the encumbering, awkward luxury which formed
the splendour of civil life during this century than the
structure of these heavy machines. The best had four
wheels; three or four horses drew them, harnessed in a
row, the postilion being mounted on one, armed with a
short-handled whip of many thongs; solid beams rested
on the axles, and above this framework rose an archway
rounded like a tunnel; as a whole, ungraceful enough.
But the details,” he goes on to say, speaking of the
carriage shown in the Louterell Psalter, “were extremely
elegant, the wheels were carved and their spokes expanded
near the hoop into ribs forming pointed arches;
the beams were painted and gilt, the inside was hung
with those dazzling tapestries, the glory of the age; the
seats were furnished with embroidered cushions; a lady
might stretch out there, half sitting, half lying; pillows
were disposed in the corners as if to invite sleep, square
windows pierced the sides and were hung with curtains.
Thus travelled,” he continues with a touch of picturesqueness,
“the noble lady, slim in form, tightly clad in a
dress which outlined every curve of the body, her long,
slender hands caressing the favourite dog or bird. The
knight, equally tightened in his <i>cote-hardie</i>, regarded her
with a complacent eye, and, if he knew good manners,
opened his heart to his dreamy companion in long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>phrases like those in the romances. The broad forehead
of the lady, who has perhaps coquettishly plucked
off her eyebrows and stray hairs, a process about which
satirists were indignant, brightens up at moments, and
her smile is like a ray of sunshine. Meanwhile the axles
groan, the horse-shoes&mdash;also heavily nailed&mdash;crunch the
ground, the machine advances by fits and starts, descends
into the hollows, bounds altogether at the ditches, and
falls violently back with a dull noise.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Other gaily decorated carriages, surprisingly like our
modern vans, though on two wheels, are shown in <i>Le
Roman du Roy Meliadus</i>, another fourteenth-century
manuscript preserved in the British Museum, but only
the richest and most powerful of the nobles could afford
to keep them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They were bequeathed,” says M. Jusserand, “by
will from one another, and the gift was valuable. On
September 25, 1355, Elizabeth de Burgh, Lady Clare,
wrote her last will and endowed her eldest daughter
with ‘her great carriage with the coverture, carpets, and
cushions.’ In the twentieth year of Richard II, Roger
Rouland received £400 sterling for a carriage destined
for Queen Isabella; and John le Charer, in the sixth
[year] of Edward III, received £1000 for the carriage
of Lady Eleanor&mdash;the King’s sister.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These were fabulous sums, when it is remembered
that an ox cost about thirteen shillings and a sheep but
one shilling and five pence.</p>

<p>Now it may be that such a “great carriage” as is
shown in the Louterell Psalter was identical with the
<i>whirlicote</i> in which, according to Stowe, Richard II and
his mother took refuge on the occasion of Wat Tyler’s
rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Of old time,” says this honest tailor, who himself
witnessed the introduction of coaches into England,
“coaches were not known in this island, but chariots or
whirlicotes, then so called, and they only used of princes
or great estates, such as had their footmen about them;
and for example to note, I read that Richard II, being
threatened by the rebels of Kent, rode from the Tower
of London to the Mile’s End, and with him his mother,
because she was sick and weak, in a whirlicote, the Earl
of Buckingham ... knights and Esquires attending on
horseback. But in the next year [1381] the said King
Richard took to wife Anne, daughter to the King of
Bohemia, that first brought hither the riding upon side
saddles; and so was the riding in whirlicotes and
chariots forsaken, except at coronations and such like
spectacles.”</p></blockquote>

<p>From this it would appear that the <i>whirlicote</i> (which
may, as Bridges Adams suggests, have been derived from
“whirling” or moving “cot” or house) was identical
with the <i>chariot</i> or <i>chaer</i>. Unfortunately the translators
of Froissart, who mentions the incident of Richard’s
ride from the Tower, cannot agree upon the correct
word to render the original <i>charette</i>. <i>Charette</i>, <i>chariette</i>,
<i>chare</i>, <i>chaer</i> (Wicliffe), and <i>char</i> (Chaucer) all occur in
the early chronicles, and there seems no means, if,
indeed, there is any need, of differentiating between
them. All were probably waggons modified for the
conveyance of such passengers as could afford to pay
highly for the privilege. One fact, however, suggests
that there were at any rate two different kinds of carriages
in England at this time, for we read that the body of
Richard II was borne to its last resting-place “upon a
chariette or sort of litter on wheels, such as is used by
citizens’ wives who are not able or not allowed to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
ordinary litters.” With this in mind, it is difficult to
agree with Sir Walter Gilbey when he says<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> that the
<i>chare</i> was a horse litter, though it is fair to add that he
acknowledges an opposite view.</p>

<p>The <i>charette</i> is obviously the French form of <i>caretta</i>,
which was the carriage in which Beatrice, the wife of
Charles of Anjou, entered Naples in 1267.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> This
vehicle is described as being covered both inside and
without with sky-blue velvet powdered with golden
lilies. Pope Gregory X entered Milan in 1273 in a
similar carriage. The <i>caretta</i> was probably an open car
“shaded simply by a canopy.” In the next century,
the <i>Anciennes Chroniques de Flandres</i>, a manuscript belonging
to 1347, shows an illustration of Ermengarde,
the wife of Salvard, Lord of Rousillon, travelling in a
four-wheeled conveyance remarkably like the ordinary
country waggon of to-day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The lady,” says Sir Walter Gilbey, “is seated on
the floor-boards of a springless four-wheeled cart or
waggon, covered in with a tilt that could be raised or
drawn aside; the body of the vehicle is of carved wood
and the outer edges of the wheels are painted grey to
represent iron tyres. The conveyance is drawn by two
horses driven by a postilion who bestrides that on the
near [left] side. The traces are apparently of rope, and
the outer trace of the postilion’s horse is represented as
passing under the saddle-girth, a length of leather (?)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>being let in for the purpose; the traces are attached to
swingle-bars carried on the end of a cross-piece secured
to the base of the pole where it meets the body.</p>

<p>“Carriages of some kind,” he continues, “appear also
to have been used by men of rank when travelling on
the Continent. <i>The Expeditions to Prussia and the Holy
Land of Henry, Earl of Derby, in</i> 1390 <i>and</i> 1392-3
(Camden Society’s Publications, 1894) indicate that the
Earl, afterwards King Henry IV of England, travelled
on wheels at least part of the way through Austria.</p>

<p>“The accounts kept by his Treasurer during the
journey contain several entries relative to carriages;
thus on November 14, 1392, payment is made for the
expenses of two equerries named Hethcote and Mansel,
who were left for one night at St. Michael, between
Leoban and Kniltefeld, with thirteen carriage horses.
On the following day the route lay over such rugged
and mountainous country that the carriage wheels were
broken despite the liberal use of grease; and at last the
narrowness of the way obliged the Earl to exchange his
own carriage for two smaller ones better suited to the
paths of the district.</p>

<p>“The Treasurer also records the sale of an old
carriage at Friola for three florins. The exchange of
the Earl’s ‘own carriage’ is the significant entry: it
seems very unlikely that a noble of his rank would have
travelled so lightly that a single cart would contain his
own luggage and that of his personal retinue; and it is
also unlikely that he used one luggage cart of his own.
The record points directly to the conclusion that the
carriages were passenger vehicles used by the Earl himself.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is to be noted that the carriage of the Lady
Ermengarde was a Flemish vehicle. Flanders, indeed,
seems to have shared with Hungary the honour of playing
pioneer in carriage-building throughout the ages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
long after the general adoption of coaches in Europe,
Flemish models, and also Flemish mares, were freely
imported into the various countries.</p>

<p>Another carriage of this time is described in a pre-Chaucerian
poem called <i>The Squyr of Low Degree</i>, in
which the father of a Hungarian princess is made to
say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Tomorrow ye shall on hunting fare,</div>
<div class="line">And ride my daughter in a <i>chare</i>.</div>
<div class="line">It shall be covered with velvet red,</div>
<div class="line">And cloths of fine gold all about your head;</div>
<div class="line">With damask white, and azure blue,</div>
<div class="line">Well diapered with lilies new;</div>
<div class="line">Your pomelles shal be ended with gold,</div>
<div class="line">Your chains enammelled many a fold.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The pomelles no doubt were “the handles to the
rods affixed to the roof, and were for the purpose of
holding on by, when deep ruts or obstacles in the road
caused an unusual jerk in the vehicle.” One notices
that lilies were apparently a common form of decoration
on these early carriages, but it is to be regretted that the
accounts in general are so scanty.</p>

<p class="tb">We come to the litters.</p>

<p>Of these the commonest, both in England and on
the Continent, seem to have been modifications of the
Roman <i>basterna</i>. Generally they were covered with a
sort of vault with various openings. Two horses, one
at either end, carried them. The great majority held
only one person. Thrupp describes them in some detail.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They were,” he says, “long and narrow&mdash;long
enough for a person to recline in&mdash;and no wider than
could be carried between the poles which were placed on
either side of the horses. They were about four to five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>feet long, and two feet six inches wide, with low sides
and higher ends. The entrance was in the middle, on
both sides, the doors being formed sometimes by a
sliding panel and sometimes simply by a cross-bar. The
steps were of leather or iron loops, the latter being
hinged to turn up when the litter was placed on the
ground. The upper part was formed by a few broad
wooden hoops, united along the top by four or five
slats, and over the whole a canopy was placed, which
opened in the middle, at the sides, and ends, for air and
light.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Isolated references to these horse-litters are scattered
throughout the old chronicles, but afford meagre information.
William of Malmesbury states that the body
of William Rufus was placed on a <i>reda caballaria</i>,
a horse-litter, the name of which suggests its origin.
According to Matthew of Westminster, King John,
during his illness in 1216, was removed from Swinstead
Abbey to Newark in a similar vehicle, the <i>lectica equestre</i>.
Generally, however, the horse-litter was reserved exclusively
for women, men being unwilling to risk an
accusation of effeminacy. So, in recording the death
of Earl Ferrers in 1254, from injuries received in an
accident to his conveyance, the historian is careful to
explain that his Lordship suffered from the gout, which
was why he happened to be in a litter at all.</p>

<p>As time passed, the litter rather than the wheeled
carriage became the state vehicle. Froissart, writing of
the second wife of Richard II, describes “la june Royne
d’Angleterre” as travelling “en une litere moult riche
qui etoit ordondée pour elle.” Margaret, the daughter
of Henry VII, journeyed to Scotland, it is true, on the
back of a “faire palfrey,” but she was followed by “one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
vary riche litere, borne by two faire coursers vary nobly
drest; in wich litere the sayd queene was borne in the
intryng of the good townes, or otherwise to her good
playsher.” But on the Continent new improvements
were being made in wheeled carriages, and when in
1432 Henry VI wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury
and other high dignitaries of the Church, with regard
to the widow of Henry of Navarre, he ordered them
to place two <i>chares</i> at her disposal, rather than the
litter to which one might have thought she would be
entitled. Sir Walter Gilbey translates the word to
mean a horse-litter, but Markland, in his paper on the
<i>Early Use of Carriages in England</i> (<i>Archæologia</i>, Vol. XX),
differentiates between the two, ascribing a more ceremonial
use to the litter, and this seems to me to be
nearer the truth. Both vehicles, for instance, are mentioned
by Holinshed in his description of the coronation
ceremony of Catherine of Aragon in 1509. The Queen
herself rode in a litter of “white clothe of golde, not
covered nor bailed, which was led by two palfreys clad
in white damask doone to the ground, head and all, led
by her footman. Over her was borne a canopie of
cloth of gold, with four gilt staves, and four silver bells.
For the bearing of which canopie were appointed sixteen
knights, foure to beare it one space on foot, and other
foure another space.” But the Queen’s ladies followed
her in <i>chariots</i> decorated in red, and the same thing is
true of Anne Boleyn, who in 1533 rode to her coronation
in a litter, but was followed by four chariots, three
decorated with red, and one with white. Such chariots
probably resembled those to be described in the next
chapter; the point to notice here is that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
being used now, and although the litters still continued
until the time of Charles II&mdash;Mary de Medicis, the
Queen-Mother of France, entered London in 1638 in a
litter, though she had travelled from Harwich in a
coach, and as late as 1680 “an accident happened to
General Shippon, who came in a horse-litter wounded to
London; when he paused by the brewhouse in St. John
Street a mastiff attacked the horses, and he was tossed
like a dog in a blanket”&mdash;the wheeled carriage once
again became the vehicle of honour, and at the coronation
of Mary in 1553 a chariot<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and not a litter was
used by the Queen. This had six horses, and was
covered with a “cloth of tissue.” Whatever its discomforts
may have been, it cannot have been less
dignified than the litter which it had, now for all time,
supplanted.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>OTH horse-litters and early wheeled carriages
seem to have had some pretensions towards
comfort. They afforded protection against
the inclemency of the weather; there had
been certain rude attempts at suspension, and the soft
cushions helped to minimise the unpleasant joltings to
which every carriage was liable. When, however, the
renaissance of carriage-building occurred, people seem
to have been but little more progressive than they had
been centuries before. There were, as I have already
hinted, still two factors which militated against a speedy
adoption of such vehicles, more comfortable though they
undoubtedly were, as now began to be made&mdash;the state
of the roads, and the dislike of anything bordering
upon the effeminate.</p>

<p>The roads had become no better. Even those most
eager to welcome the new carriages must have been
dismayed at the state of the country, not only in
England, but in every European country. As one
writer of the sixteenth century complains, the roads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
“by reason of straitness and disrepair, breed a loathsome
weariness to the passenger.” Nor is this writer a
solitary grumbler: there are numerous complaints. In
1537 Richard Bellasis, one of the monastery-wreckers,
was unable to proceed with his work: “lead from the
roofs,” he reports, “cannot be conveyed away till next
summer, for the ways in that countrie are so foule and
deepe that no carriage [cart] can pass in winter.”
Indeed, no one seems to have looked after the roads
with any care, either in the fifteenth or the sixteenth
century. Yet there were, in this country, repeated
bequests for their preservation. Henry Clifford, Earl
of Cumberland, a sufferer himself, left one hundred
marks to be bestowed on the highways in Craven, and
the same sum on those of Westmorland. John Lyon,
the founder of Harrow School, gave certain rents
for the repair of the roads from Harrow and Edgware
to London. This was in 1592, and Lyon’s example
was speedily followed by Sutton, the founder of the
Charterhouse. There was, indeed, legislation of a kind,
but in general the roads were in a terrible condition,
and for a long time, so far as men were concerned, the
saddle remained triumphant.</p>

<p>And for an even longer time continued that prejudice
against carriages which led to the framing of actual
prohibitive laws. Even women were occasionally forbidden
the use of coaches, and there is the story of the
luxurious duchess who in 1546 found great difficulty in
obtaining from the Elector of Saxony permission to be
driven in a covered carriage to the baths&mdash;such leave
being granted only on the understanding that none of
her attendants were to be allowed the same privilege.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
So, too, in 1564, Pope Pius IV was exhorting his
cardinals and bishops to leave the new-fangled machines
to women, and twenty-four years later Julius, Duke of
Brunswick, found it necessary to issue an edict&mdash;it
makes quaint reading now&mdash;ordering his “vassals,
servants, and kinsmen, without distinction, young and
old,” who “have dared to give themselves up to
indolence and to riding in coaches ... to take notice
that when We order them to assemble, either altogether
or in part, in Times of Turbulence, or to receive their
Fiefs, or when on other occasions they visit Our Court,
they shall not travel or appear in Coaches, but on their
riding Horses.” More stringent is the edict, preserved
amongst the archives of the German county of Mark, in
which the nobility was forbidden the use of coaches
“under penalty of incurring the punishment of felony.”
So, also, we have the case of René de Laval, Lord of
Bois-Dauphin, an extremely obese nobleman living in
Paris, whose only excuse for possessing a coach was
his inability to be set upon a horse, or to keep in that
position if the horse chanced to move. This was in
1550. In England there was a similar feeling of
opposition. In 1584 John Lyly, in his play <i>Alexander
and Campaspe</i>, makes one of his characters complain of
the new luxury. In the old days, he says, those who
used to enter the battlefield on hard-trotting horses,
now ride in coaches and think of nothing but the
pleasures of the flesh. The once famous Bishop Hall
speaks bitterly of the “sin-guilty” coach:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Is’t not a shame to see each homely groome</div>

<div class="line">In a sin-guilty coach, not closely pent,</div>
<div class="line">Jogging along the harder pavement.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Possibly the same idea is to be found in the framing
of a Parliamentary Bill of 1601 “to restrain the
excessive use of coaches,” which, however, was thrown
out. So again in 1623, the delightful though sadly
biased water-poet, John Taylor, is lamenting the
decadence of England, due, according to him, to the
growing custom of driving in coaches.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For whereas,” he says, “within our memories, our
Nobility and Gentry would ride well mounted (and
sometimes walke on foote) gallantly attended with three
or four, score brave fellowes in blue coates, which was
a glory to our Nation; and gave more content to the
beholders, then [<i>sic</i>] forty of your Leather tumbrels:
Then men preserv’d their bodies strong and able by
walking, riding, and other manly exercises: Then
saddlers was a good Trade, and the name of a Coach
was Heathen Greek. Who ever saw (but upon extraordinary
occasions),” he goes on to ask, “Sir <i>Philip
Sidney</i>, Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, Sir <i>John Norris</i>, Sir <i>William
Winter</i>, Sir <i>Roger Williams</i>, or (whom I should have
nam’d first) the famous Lord <i>Gray</i> and <i>Willoughby</i>,
when the renowned <i>George</i> Earle of <i>Cumberland</i>, or
<i>Robert</i> Earle of <i>Essex</i>? These sonnes of <i>Mars</i>, who
in their time were the glorious Brooches of our Nation,
and admirable terrour to our Enemies: these, I say,
did make small use of Coaches, and there were two
mayne reasons for it, the one was, that there were but
few Coaches in most of their times: and the second
is, they were deadly foes to all sloth and effeminacy.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To Taylor, indeed, and probably to every one of his
fellow-watermen, a coach was always a “hell-cart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>”
designed on purpose to put an end to his own most
worthy calling. But less biased poets than outspoken
Taylor gave tongue to an opposition which continued
for nearly two centuries. Gay, for instance, looked on
the vastly improved vehicle of his day as no more than
an excuse for extravagant display:&mdash;</p>

<div class="line i04">“What walker shall his mean ambition fix</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>And so late as 1770, the eccentric Lord Monboddo,
who still maintained the superiority of a savage life,
refused to “sit in a box drawn by brutes.” It is, of
course, easy to magnify such opposition to coaches as
followed on the grounds of mere luxury and display,
but in the earlier history of the coach, to which we
are now come, it is a factor which must by no means
be neglected. The coach, like every other novelty, had
to fight its way, and if one is inclined to believe, after
reading such accusations as there are of the earliest
coaches with their magnificent adornments and numerous
attendants, that the owners altogether deserved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
reproaches of their more Spartan fellows, it may be well
to recall Macaulay’s words. In his sketch of the state
of England in 1685, when coaches were still lavishly
adorned, he says of them: “We attribute to magnificence
what was really the effect of a very disagreeable
necessity. People in the time of Charles the Second
travelled with six horses, because with a smaller number
there was great danger of sticking fast in the mire.”
And what is true of 1685 is certainly true of 1585.</p>

<p>Buckingham is supposed to have been the first
man to use a coach and six in this country, though this
is by no means certain. Of him a well-known story
apropos of this question of undue luxury is told. “The
stout old Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>,” it runs, “when he got
loose, hearing that the great Favourite <i>Buckingham</i> was
drawn about with a Coach and six horses (which was
wondered at then as a <i>novelty</i>, and imputed to him as a
<i>mastring pride</i>) thought if <i>Buckingham</i> had six he might
very well have eight in his Coach, with which he rode
through the City of <i>London</i> to the <i>Bath</i>, to the vulgar
talk and admiration.... Nor did this addition of two
horses by <i>Buckingham</i> grow higher than a little <i>murmur</i>.
For in the late Queen’s time there were no coaches, and
the first [had] but two Horses; the rest crept in by
<i>Degrees</i> as men at first venture to <i>sea</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Yet what may
have been true of Buckingham, whose love of luxury
was notorious, need not have been true of those other
owners of coaches, who were constantly travelling about
the country.</p>

<p>Finally there is the other side of the question to be
remembered, and, as M. Ramde quaintly points out in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
his <i>History of Locomotion</i>, the very luxury which
people so disliked had a beneficent effect; for “after the
development of the use of carriages, and their frequent
employment by the court and nobility, the liberty to
throw everything out of the window became intolerable!
Thus the carriage of luxury has been the cause of
cleanliness in the streets.”</p>

<p>Now it must be understood that the coach proper
differs from all earlier vehicles in being not only a
covered, but also a suspended carriage. The canopy
has given place to the roof, a roof, that is to say, which
forms part of the framing of the body; and the body
itself is swung in some fashion, however primitive, from
posts or other supports. Further, it seems reasonable
to suppose, on the analogy of the <i>berlin</i> and the <i>landau</i>&mdash;two
later carriages which took their names from the
towns in which they were first made&mdash;that the first
coaches were built in a small Hungarian town then
called Kotzee. Yet it is to be observed that Spain,
Italy, and France, in the persons of various enthusiasts,
have claimed the invention&mdash;their claims being mainly
based on such similarities as may be observed between
the real coach and the earlier cars and charettes.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Bridges Adams, indeed, not to be outdone, hazards the
suggestion that England might also be included in such
a list by reason of her invention of the whirlicote,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>though he is obliged to admit that nobody knows <i>exactly</i>
what a whirlicote was like. It is probably due to these
patriotic gentlemen that several rather ludicrous suggestions
have been made to explain the derivation of the
word <i>coach</i>, which has a similar sound in nearly all
European languages. Menange rashly suggests a corruption
of the Latin <i>vehiculum</i>. Another writer puts
forward the Greek verb ὀχέω, to carry. Wachten, a
German, finds in <i>kutten</i>, to cover, a suitable explanation,
and Lye produces the Flemish <i>koetsen</i>, to lie along.
This last, perhaps, is the most reasonable suggestion of
those unwilling to give the palm to Hungary, for not
only were the Flemish vehicles well known before the
introduction of the new carriage, but there is also some
confusion, at any rate, in this country, between the two
words <i>coach</i> and <i>couch</i>, both being found in the old
account books. Even in the sixteenth century the word
seems to have bothered people. There is an amusing
reference to this point in an early seventeenth-century
tract called <i>Coach and Sedan Pleasantly Disputing</i>, of
which I shall have more to say in the next chapter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Their first invention,” says a character in this
dialogue, “and use was in the Kingdome of <i>Hungarie</i>,
about the time when <i>Frier George</i>, compelled the Queen
and her young sonne the King, to seeke to <i>Soliman</i> the
Turkish Emperour, for aid against the Frier, and some
of the Nobilitie, to the utter ruine of that most rich
and flourishing Kingdome, where they were first called
<i>Kottcze</i>, and in the <i>Slavonian</i> tongue <i>Cottri</i>, not of
<i>Coucher</i> the French to lie-downe, nor of <i>Cuchey</i>, the Cambridge
Carrier, as some body made Master <i>Minshaw</i>,
when hee (rather wee) perfected his Etymologicall
dictionarie, whence we call them to this day <i>Coaches</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>It is also to be noted that the first English coaches,
so called, were probably not suspended at all, but merely
upholstered carts for reclining&mdash;in fact nothing more
than the old chariots. In the second half of the sixteenth
century, practically every pleasure carriage in
England, though not on the Continent, was called a <i>coach</i>
or a <i>carroche</i>. Consequently it is difficult to give a date
for the importation of the first real coach into this
country. Indeed, it is impossible to say with any
degree of certainty precisely when carriages of the
suspended type were first made. Such early accounts
as exist are at once fragmentary and obscure, and the
few illustrations little better than caricatures with a perspective
reminiscent of that in Hogarth’s famous example
of false drawing. It can only be repeated that the
hammock slung from the four posts of a waggon, such
as we have seen existed amongst the Anglo-Saxons and
possibly was also in use in parts of Europe, may have
provided the idea of permanent suspension as a means
to comfort, and that such scanty evidence as there is
goes to prove that the carriages exported from Hungary
towards the end of the fifteenth century seem to have
been the first <i>coaches</i> to be built.</p>

<p>So early as 1457 there is mention of such a carriage,
given by Ladislaus, King of Hungary, to the French
King, Charles VII. The Parisians who saw it described
it as “branlant et moulte riche.” What this “trembling”
carriage was like there is no means of discovering,
but it certainly suggests an attempt at suspension,
and may perhaps be taken for the earliest coach to be
recorded by history. This obviously was Hungarian,
and Hungary is again mentioned in the same connec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>tion
by Stephanus Broderithus, who relates that in
1526, “when the archbishop received intelligence that
the Turks had entered Hungary, not content with informing
the King of this event, he speedily got into
one of those light carriages which from the name of the
place we call kotcze, and hastened to His Majesty.”
And apparently these light carriages were actually used
for military purposes, Taylor avowing that “they carried
soldiers on each side with cross-bowes,” this being the
best purpose to which he considered the coach had ever
been put or was likely to be put in the future. All
this is clear enough, but Beckmann, in his <i>History
of Inventions</i>, mentions another circumstance which
strengthens the evidence: “Siegmund, Baron de Herberstein,
ambassador from Louis II, to the King of
Hungary, says in his <i>Commentarie de rebus Moscoviticis</i>,
where he occasionally mentions some travelling-stages
in Hungary: ‘The fourth stage for stopping to give
the horses breath is six miles below Taurinum, in the
village of Cotzi, from which both drivers and carriages
take their name, and are generally called cotzi.’”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Very probably these new Hungarian carriages were
seen in most European countries before 1530. “At
tournaments,” says Bridges Adams, “they were made
objects for display; they are spoken of as being gilded
all over, and the hangings were of crimson satin.
Electresses and duchesses were seldom without them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>and there was as much rivalry in their days of public
exhibition as there is now [1837] amongst the aspirants
of fashion in their well-appointed equipages at a queen’s
drawing-room.”</p>

<p>What did these early coaches look like? Shorn of
their hangings, they must have resembled nothing so
much as the hearse of to-day. The first illustrations
show no signs of suspension, and portray what appear
to be gaudily decorated waggons, and that in effect is
what they were. The first coach makers of Hungary,
like their predecessors, were certainly content to take
for their model the common agricultural waggon of
Germany. Indeed, Hungary seems to have played pioneer
in this respect at a very early date. Von Ginzrot, in
his work on early vehicles, gives an illustration of a
closed passenger carriage which bears more than a superficial
resemblance to the later coaches. “The body,”
says Thrupp, “is a disguised waggon; the tilt-top has
two leather flaps to fall over the doorway, and the
panels are of wicker-work.” It would have been quite
easy, he continues, to use such waggons, as had been
the case long before, for passenger traffic, “by placing
the planks across the sides, or suspending seats by
straps from the sides”; and he further mentions an
oil painting at Nuremberg, of two waggons “with
carved and gilt standard posts both in front and behind
the body”&mdash;an interesting stage in the transformation
from rude cart to private coach. There is a detailed
and technical description of these waggons in Thrupp’s
own book, but it will be enough here to notice that
they were generally narrower at the bottom than at the
top, as were the first coaches, and that the four wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
were nearly of the same size. Working from such a
model, the Hungarian artificers produced a comparatively
light, though large, four-wheeled carriage with
some pretensions to grace of line, a roofed body, broad
seats, and a side entrance. The body, however, was
not completely enclosed by solid panels, which only
took the place of the curtains at a later date. Carvings
and other ornamentation followed on the owner’s rank
and taste. And towards the end of the sixteenth century,
if not before, the actual body was suspended on
straps or braces. There are preserved at Coburg and
Verona one or two coach-bodies which show signs of
the iron hoops by which they were hung. The earliest
of these was built for Duke Frederick of Saxony in
1527, and Count Gozzadini, in a slim folio which he
privately printed some sixty years ago, describes a coach-body
built in 1549 which still shows traces of its
heraldic ornamentation on the framework.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This coach,” says Thrupp, acting as the Count’s
translator, “was built under the direction of an Italian at
Brussels, for the ceremony of the marriage of Alexander,
the son of Octavius Farnese, Duke of Parma, with a Portuguese
princess. The wedding took place in 1565 at
Brussels. There were four carriages Flanders fashion
[? charettes] and four coaches after the Italian fashion,
swinging on leather braces. The chief, or state, coach is
described as being in the most beautiful manner, with four
statues at the ends, the spokes of the wheels like fluted
columns. There were seraphims’ heads at the end of
the roof and over the doorway, and festoons of fruit in
relief over the framing of the body. The coachman
was supported by two carved figures of lions, two
similar lions were at the hind wheel, and the leather
braces that supported the body and the harness were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>embossed with heads of animals. The ends of the
steps were serpents’ heads. The whole of the wood
and ironwork was covered with gold relieved with white.
The coach was drawn by four horses, with red and white
plumes of feathers, and the covering of the body and
of the horses was gold brocade with knotted red silk
fringe. The cushions of gold-embroidered stuff were
perfumed with amber and musk, that infused the soul
of all who entered the coach with life, joy, and supreme
pleasure.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Truly a Southern notion!</p>

<p>What is apparently the oldest coach to be preserved
practically intact is to be seen at Coburg. This coach
was built for a particular occasion&mdash;the marriage of
John, Elector of Saxony, in 1584. The body is long
and ornate, and is hung from four carved standard posts
surmounted by crowned lions. The wheels are large&mdash;four
feet eight inches and five feet&mdash;and the roof is at
a slightly higher level than the lions’ heads. Mounting
steps must have existed, but have been lost.</p>

<p>Not unnaturally the advent of these coaches followed
upon the commercial prosperity of each country.
Germany seems to have imported a number of carriages
from Hungary, and made others from Hungarian
models, but even more prosperous than Germany at this
time was Holland, which probably possessed more
coaches than any other country in Europe. Here there
would have been native designs to follow and improve
upon, and, as I shall show in a moment, it was probably
from the Netherlands that the first coach was imported
into England. Antwerp, for instance, a superlatively
rich city in the sixteenth century, is credited by Macpherson
with having no less than five hundred coaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
&mdash;and so five hundred scandals, according to the local
philosophers&mdash;in 1560, at which date London had but
two, and Paris no more than three. Of the French
trio of <i>carosses</i>, as they were called, one was the Queen’s
property, a second belonged to the fashionable Diana of
Poitiers, and the third had been built for the use of that
corpulent noble who has already been mentioned. Some
Italian towns possessed many, others none. There is
preserved at the Musée Cluny in Paris a Veronese
<i>carriole</i> built in the sixteenth century by Giovanna Batta
Maretto, with panels painted by a distinguished artist
of the time. Verona, indeed, seems to have had many
coaches. But it was easily surpassed by Ferrara, which
so early as 1509 is credited with the possession of no
less than sixty coaches, the whole of these forming the
Duke’s procession on the occasion of a state visit from
the Pope. And, as Thrupp points out, these sixty
carriages were not litters or cars, as might be supposed,
but coaches, for it is particularly mentioned by the historian
that “the Duchess of Ferrara rode in a <i>litter</i>, and
her ladies followed her in twenty-two <i>cars</i>.” Spain had
apparently no coaches until 1546, and here again there
was considerable opposition to their use. Yet although
England, France, and Spain seem to have been behind
other countries in taking to the new carriages, all three
possessed a flourishing, if not very large, coach-building
trade before 1600.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><i>From a Print by Hofnagel</i>, 1582</p></div>

<p>Here, perhaps, we may consider the introduction of
the coach into England in rather greater detail. “It is
a doubtful question,” remarks Taylor in his ill-natured
way,” whether the divell brought <i>Tobacco</i> into England
in a <i>Coach</i>, or else brought a <i>Coach</i> in a fogge or mist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
<i>Tobacco</i>.” Apparently he had an equal dislike for both
coach and tobacco. But although we owe to the water-poet
such contemporary satirical writings on the subject
as there are, he is not to be trusted as an historian.
Taylor, indeed, is a very bad historian, not so much on
account of his inability to see two sides of a question,
as because, like many another poet, he has made of
exaggeration a fine art, and allowed his memory to play
second fiddle to his inclinations. It is to the worthy
Stowe that we must turn for the facts. Stowe liked the
coaches little better than did Taylor, but his training
had made him exact, and we may take it for granted
that he is more or less correct when he says that the
first coach to be seen upon British roads belonged to
the year 1555. Curiously enough, this is the date of
the first General Highways Act. The preamble of this
Bill stated that certain roads were “now both very noisesome
and tedious to travel in and dangerous to all
passengers and carriages [carts].” The local authorities
were empowered to compel parishioners to give four
days’ work every year to the repairing of the roads,
though how far such orders were carried out it would
be impossible to say. The merit of actually introducing
the coach is given by Stowe to Henry Manners, second
Earl of Rutland, who caused one Walter Rippon to
build him a carriage from some foreign, most probably
Dutch, pattern. This Earl of Rutland had borne the
Spurs at the coronation of Edward VI, and in 1547
had been made Constable of Nottingham Castle. He
had received the French hostages in 1550 at the time
of the treaty which followed on the loss of Boulogne.
It is to be regretted that neither in his correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>nor in the family account-books preserved at Belvoir
is there mention of either Rippon or his coach. There
is, indeed, the “Book of John Leek of riding charges
carriages [carts] and forrene paymentes” in 1550, and
another book compiled by Leek’s successor, George
Pilkington, in the following year, but all travelling
entries concern only horses and the cartage of goods.
In 1555 “George Lassells, Esquyer” was “Comptroller
to the householde” and paid “to Edward Hopkynson
for ij ryding roddes of bone for my Ladye and other
thinges, xxij<i>d</i>,” but there is no mention of any carriage
for his Lordship’s own use. What is more unfortunate
is that there are no account-books of the Manners
family between 1559 and 1585, and it is not until 1587,
when a fourth Earl of Rutland was head of his house,
that this significant entry occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Coach, a newe, bought in London, xxxviij<i>li</i>.xiij<i>s</i>.ij<i>d</i>.”</p>

<p>To go back to Rippon, it is not known who he was.
He is supposed to have built a coach for Queen Mary
in 1556, and in 1564 the first “hollow turning coach”
with pillars and arches, for Queen Elizabeth, though
precisely what is meant by a “hollow turning” coach it
is difficult to conjecture. This same Rippon twenty-four
years later built another coach for the Queen, which is
described as “a chariot throne with foure pillars behind,
to beare a crowne imperiale on the toppe, and before
two lower pillars, whereon stood a lion and a dragon,
the supporters of the armes of England.” It cannot
have been very comfortable, and Elizabeth seems to
have preferred another coach brought out of Holland
by one William Boonen, who about 1560 was made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
coachman, a position he was still occupying at the end
of the century. This Boonen was a Dutchman, whose
wife is said to have introduced the art of starching into
England, whence followed those huge ruffs so conspicuous
in all the Elizabethan portraits. Boonen’s coach could
be opened and closed at pleasure. On the occasion of
the Queen’s passing through the town of Warwick, she
had “every part and side of her coach to be opened,
that all her subjects present might behold her, which
most gladly they desired.” This coach is described as
“on four wheels with seven spokes, which are apparently
bound round with a thick wooden rim secured by pegs.
It is precisely such a vehicle,” adds the anonymous
historian in the <i>Carriage Builder’s and Harness Maker’s Art
Journal</i>, “as is now [1860] used by the brewers, with a
tilt over it, which opens in the centre on one side, and
would contain half a dozen persons.” On the other
hand, one may safely assert that no brewer’s cart was
ever decorated in the same way, for the framing of
Elizabeth’s carriage was of wood carved in a shell pattern
and gilded. “The whole composition,” runs another
account, “contains many beautiful curves. The shell-work
creeps up to the roof, which it supports, and which
is dome-shaped.... The roof is capped by five waving
ostrich feathers, one at each corner, and the fifth on the
centre of the roof, and springing from a kind of crown.”
The driver’s seat was apparently a kind of movable
stool, and two horses were used. Even this coach,
however, of which there is a print by Hoefnagle, dated
1582, cannot have been very comfortable, and in 1568,
when the French ambassador obtained an audience,
Elizabeth was complaining of “aching pains” from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
being knocked about in a coach driven too fast a few
days before. “No wonder,” comments one historian,
“that the great queen used her coach only when occasions
of state demanded.” Whenever possible, indeed, she
used her horse. “When Queen Elizabeth came to
Norwich, 1578,” wrote Sir Thomas Browne a hundred
years later, “she came on horseback from Ipswich, by
the high road to Norwich, in the summer time; but she
had a coach or two,” he added, “in her trayne.”</p>

<p>In the print just mentioned there is shown a second
coach, which is perhaps a better example of the carriage
of the period. One sees again its hearse-like appearance,
though the top is broader than the bottom, and the
body is partially enclosed; but there is one peculiarity
which deserves particular mention. This was a small
seat which projected on either side, between the wheels.
It was known as the boot. Here sat the pages or grooms
or the ladies in attendance. Taylor, of course, has his
fling against it. The booted coach, he says, is like a perpetual
cheater, wears “two Bootes and no Spurs, sometimes
having two paire of Legs and one boote; and
oftentimes (against nature) most preposterously it makes
faire Ladies weare the boote; and if you note, they are
carrried backe to backe like people surpriz’d by Pyrats
to be tyed in that miserable manner, and throwne overboard
into the Sea. Moreover, it makes people imitate
Sea-crabs, in being drawne Side-wayes, as they are when
they sit in the boote of the Coach.” The boot, however,
was already tending to disappear in Taylor’s day.
How it originated is not clear. It was always uncovered,
whence followed much hardship, particularly
if the weather was unfavourable. Nor can one think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
that it was very capacious. There is an early seventeenth-century
pamphlet entitled <i>My Journie</i>, in which a stout
old lady is put into the boot of a coach, and cannot
move. When going uphill all the passengers are
supposed to get out and walk, but the old lady, once
settled, refuses to budge, and, indeed, cannot be extricated
until the end of the journey. There is further
mention of the discomfort in a boot in 1663, when
Edward Barker, writing to his father, a Lancashire
squire, complains of his troubles in the side seat. “I
got to London,” he says, “on Saturday last, my journey
was noe ways pleasant, being forced to ride in the boote
all the waye, y<sup>e</sup> company y<sup>t</sup> came up w<sup>th</sup> mee were persons
of greate quality as knightes and ladyes. My journeys
expence was 30 <i>s.</i> This traval hath soe indisposed
mee, y<sup>t</sup> I am resolved never to ride againe in y<sup>e</sup> coatch.
I am extreamly hot and feverish.” The monstrous
width of these early coaches followed, of course, on their
projecting side seats, which only entirely disappeared
when the coach had come to be completely enclosed and
provided with glass windows.</p>

<p>It may be that the boot in process of time was metamorphosed
into the large, deep, four-sided basket which
was strapped to the back of public coaches in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, and, indeed, this basket
seems to have been called the boot in eighteenth-century
stage coaches. It was probably in such a basket-boot
as this that Mr. Pepys put his great barrel of oysters,
“as big as sixteen others,” which was given him in 1664.</p>

<p>An interesting point in this connection is that those
who travelled on the seatless and presumably most
uncomfortable roof of a coach plying for hire, paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
more for the privilege than did those who rode in the
boot.</p>

<p>However greatly the chroniclers may differ as to the
date of the actual introduction, and others besides Taylor
disagree with Stowe, there seems no doubt that by 1585
many of the nobility and some wealthy commoners
owned private coaches, and, indeed, certain enterprising
tradesmen, as will appear, let other coaches on hire at
so much per day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“After a while,” says Stowe, “divers great ladies, with
a great jealousy of the Queen’s displeasure, made them
coaches and rid them up and down the countries, to the
great admiration of all the beholders, but then little by
little they grew usual amongst the nobilitie and others
of sort, and within twenty years became a great trade of
coach-making.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, every one of any wealth was eager to possess
them. A private coach settled any doubts as to your
quality. It was a new fashion, a new excitement. “So
a woman,” says Quicksilver, the rake, in <i>Eastward Hoe</i>,
“marry to ride in a coach, she cares not if she rides to
her ruin. ’Tis the great end of many of their marriages.”
And again, in Ben Jonson’s <i>Alchemist</i> it is said of the
Countess that she</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“... has her pages, ushers</div>
<div class="line">Her six mares&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Nay, eight!</div>
<div class="line">To hurry her through London, to the Exchange,</div>
<div class="line">Bethlem, the china-houses&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">Yes, and have</div>
<div class="line">The citizens gape at her, and praise her tires.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even the plain country-folk seem to have been
smitten with the new toy, for toy it was to them. “Has
he ne’er a little odd cart,” asks Waspe in <i>Bartholomew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Fair</i>, “for you to make a coach on, in the country, with
four pied hobby-horses?” Any shift for a coach,
thought he, and no doubt voiced public opinion.</p>

<p>The first owners of coaches appear to have been those
who had travelled abroad. So early as 1556, Sir
Thomas Hoby, who had been our ambassador to
France, possessed a coach and offered to lend it to the
Lady Cecil. The account-book for 1573 of the Kytson
family, of Hengrave, in Suffolk, mentions another early
coach. “For my m<sup>res</sup> [mistress’s] coche, with all the furniture
thereto belonging except horses&mdash;xxxiiij<i>li.</i>xiiij<i>s.</i>
For the painting of my m<sup>r</sup> and m<sup>res</sup> armes upon the
coche&mdash;ij<i>s.</i>vj<i>d.</i>” In 1579 the Earl of Arundel is said
to have brought a coach into England from Germany,
and this coach is interesting from the fact that certain
historians have credited it with being the first coach in
England. How such a tradition arose is not clear, but
it may be that this German coach had certain features
which more nearly approached those of the later Stuart,
fully-enclosed, coaches. Further details are to be found
in the Manners notebooks, and these afford a glimpse
of the methods adopted by the coachmakers, not yet a
large body, of the day. In the notebooks of Thomas
Screven, 1596-97, after an item for twenty-eight shillings
for three-quarters of “scarlet sleves and labelles
for his L[ordship’s] parlyament robes” comes another
of six shillings “to my Lady Adeline’s coachman,” and
one, just below, of greater interest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Item paid to Wm. Wright, coachmaker, in parte of
xl<i>li.</i> for a coache now made, xx<i>li.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, in the 1598-99 book comes an item to
“the Countess of South[ampton’s] coachman that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
wayted on my Lord to Dertford, v<i>s.</i>” This suggests
the growing popularity of the coach, more especially as
there is another disbursement in the same year to the
Countess of Essex’s coachman. Then follow from
November 25th, 1598, details of the expenses of the new
coach for my Lord’s own use&mdash;which apparently took
considerable time to furnish.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Item for ij paire of new wheeles for the coache,
tymber worke and iron work, and setting them on the
axeltrees, iij<i>li.</i>xiij<i>s.</i>iiij<i>d.</i>; payntinge them in oyle colour,
vj<i>s.</i>viij<i>d.</i>; a new pole for the horses to drawe by,
ij<i>s.</i>vj<i>d.</i>; a paire of springe trees, iij<i>s.</i>iij<i>d.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>The provender bill for six horses is given, also an
item “for setting up the coach horses at dyvers times at
Walsingham Howse, iiij<i>s.</i>; at Hatton Howse, xij<i>d.</i>; at
Baynardes Castle, ij<i>s.</i>; dressing and oyling the coach,
ij<i>s.</i>”; while the most necessary whip costs Mr. Screven
twelve pence. Other payments are six shillings for two
new bearing braces for the “double hanging” of the
coach&mdash;here at any rate is definite mention of suspension,
a fact which might suggest that, after all, either
Rippon’s or Lord Arundel’s coach had been of the
suspended type&mdash;four shillings for a long spring brace,
two shillings and sixpence for a new “wynge,” and sixteen
pence for two “bearing raynes.” The new coach,
however, is not ready in time for his Lordship, who
thereupon hires one with three horses to take him “to the
Court at Nonesuch, 23, 24, and 25 of September, at xvj<i>s.
per diem</i>.” Meanwhile payments for his own coach continue.
For four “skynnes of orange colour leather
goate” he pays various sums; for the timber work, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
more painting, for a covering in “black lether,” and for
making the “curtaynes, and setting on the firinge, and
making the blew cloth cover” a sum of twenty-six
pounds, nineteen shillings, is expended. Nor is this
all. My Lord was evidently determined to make his
coach as gorgeous as possible. Nine yards of “marygold
coulour velvet for the seat and bed in the coach”
were required, and each yard cost twenty-three shillings.
The quilting for the bed cost forty shillings. In addition,
there was a lace of “crymosin silk” and no less
than “v elles of crymosin taffaty for curtaynes,” costing
three pounds fifteen shillings; also “9 yardes of blew
clothe for a cover.” Then, of great interest, comes the
final entry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Item, paid to Ryly, embroderer, in full for embrodering
iij sumpter clothes of crymosin with his L[ordship’s]
armes thereon at large, and vij otheres embrodered
onely with great peacocks, with carsey for the garding
and tasselles and frynge, 14 July, lxiiij<i>li.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Ryly was well paid for his work<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.</p>

<p>From such details it is possible to imagine what this
and other coaches of the time were like. You figure a
huge, gaudy, curtained apparatus with projecting sides
and incomplete panels, large enough to contain a fair-sized
bed, hung roughly from four posts, and capable of
being dragged at little better than a snail’s pace&mdash;“four-wheeled
Tortoyses” Taylor calls them&mdash;along roads
hardly worthy of the name. Twenty miles a day was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>considered good going. Says Portia, in the <i>Merchant of
Venice</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“... I’ll tell thee all my whole device</div>
<div class="line">When I am in my coach, which stays for us</div>
<div class="line">At the park gate; and therefore haste away,</div>
<div class="line">For we must measure twenty miles to-day.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The coachman, as we learn from the water-poet, was
“mounted (his fellow-horses and himselfe being all in
a finery) with as many varieties of laces, facings, Clothes
and Colours as are in the Rainebowe.” Nor was he
over-polite, particularly if the coach he drove was hired.
In Jonson’s <i>Staple of News</i> one of the pieces of mock-news
to appear in the ideal paper concerns the fraternity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i10">“and coachmen</div>
<div class="line">To mount their boxes reverently, and drive</div>
<div class="line">Like lapwings with a shell upon their heads</div>
<div class="line">Through the streets.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They seem to have thought that their finery allowed
them to treat the pedestrians with but scant respect.
And no wonder these “way-stopping whirligigges,” as
Taylor calls the coaches, surprised the inhabitants.
When one of them was seen for the first time, “some
said it was a great Crab-shell brought out of <i>China</i>,
and some imagin’d it to be one of the Pagan Temples
in which the Cannibals adored the devill.” For some
time, indeed, the coaches must have given the common
folk something to think about. A coach rumbling along
brought them to their windows, just as the horseless
carriage, centuries later, proved a similar attraction.
There is a scene in <i>Eastward Hoe</i> which well illustrates
this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Enter a Coachman in haste in ’s frock, feeding.</i></p>

<p><i>Fond.</i> O God, and we citizens should lose such a
sight!</p>

<p><i>Gazer.</i> I warrant here will be double as many people to
see her take coach, as there were to see it take water.</p></blockquote>

<p>My lady’s point of view is put forward by Lady
Eitherside in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>. Says she:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“If we once see it under the seals, wench, then,</div>

<div class="line">And my three women; we will live, i’ faith,</div>
<div class="line">The example of the town, and govern it.</div>
<div class="line">I’ll lead the fashion still.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Contemporary references to coaches, however, are but
scarce. The most important of these is Taylor’s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
<i>The World runnes on Wheeles: or, Oddes betwixt Carts and
Coaches</i>, an amusing pamphlet written in prose and not
in verse, because the author, as he says, was lame at
the time of its composition, and because beyond the
three words, broach, Roach, and encroach, he could
find no suitable rhymes. Encroach, however, he thinks
might have done, for that word, as he explains in his
dedication to various companies likely to suffer from the
importation of the coach, “best befits it, for I think
never such an impudent, proud Intruder or Encroacher
came into the world as a Coach is; for it hath driven
many honest Families out of their Houses, many Knights
to Beggers, Corporations to poverty, Almesdeedes to all
misdeedes, Hospitality to extortion, Plenty to famine,
Humility to pride, Compassion to oppression, and all
Earthly goodnes to an utter confusion.” To the cart
he does not object, but for the “hyred Hackney-hell-carts”
he cannot find sufficient abuse. His arguments
in favour of carts as against coaches are certainly novel,
if not entirely convincing as coming from a waterman
well used to live passengers himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“And as necessities and things,” he says, “whose
commodious uses cannot be wanted, are to be respected
before Toyes and trifles (whose beginning is Folly,
continuance Pride, and whose End is Ruine) I say as
necessity is to be preferred before superfluity, so is the
<i>Cart</i> before the <i>Coach</i>; For Stones, Timber, Corne,
Wine, Beere, or any thing that wants life, there is a
necessity they should be carried, because they are dead
things and cannot go on foot, which necessity the honest
<i>Cart</i> doth supply: But the <i>Coach</i>, like a superfluous
bable, or uncharitable Miser, doth seldom or never
carry or help any dead or helplesse thing; but on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>contrary, it helps those that can helpe themselves ...
and carries men and women, who are able to goe or
run; <i>Ergo</i>, the <i>Cart</i> is necessary, and the <i>Coach</i> superfluous.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, the coach, according to poor Taylor, is directly
responsible for every calamity from which the country
has suffered since its introduction. Leather has become
dearer, the horses in their traces are being prostituted,
and there is a “universal decay of the best ash-trees.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A Wheele-wright,” he continues, “or a maker of
Carts, is an ancient, a profitable and a Trade, which by
no meanes can be wanted: yet so poore it is, that
scarce the best amongst them can hardly ever attaine
to better than a Calves skin fate, or a piece of beefe and
Carret rootes to dinner on a Sunday; nor scarcely any
of them is ever mounted to any Office above the degree
of a Scavenger, or a Tything-man at the most. On
the contrary, your Coachmakers trade is the most gaine-fullest
about the Towne, they are apparelled in Sattens
and Velvets, and Masters of their Parish, Vestry-men,
who fare like the Emperors <i>Heliogabalus</i> or <i>Sardanapalus</i>,
seldome without their Mackroones, Parmisants, Jellies
and Kickshawes, with baked Swannes, Pasties hot, or
cold red Deere Pyes, which they have fro their Debtor
Worships in the Country: neither are these Coaches
onely thus cumbersome by their Rumbling and Rutting,
as they are by their standing still, and damming up the
streetes and lanes, as the Blacke Friers, and divers
other places can witnes, and against Coachmakers
doores the streets are so pestered and clogg’d with
them, that neither man, horse or cart can passe for
them; in so much as my Lord Maior is highly to bee
commended for his care in their restraint, sending in
February last, many of them to the Courtes for their
carelessnesse herein.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>In another work of Taylor’s, <i>The Thiefe</i>, there is a
passage of equal interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Carroaches, Coaches, Jades and Flanders Mares</div>
<div class="line">Do rob us of our shares, our wares, our Fares:</div>
<div class="line">Against the ground we stand and knock our heeles,</div>
<div class="line">Whilest all our profit runs away on wheeles;</div>
<div class="line">And whosoever but observes and notes,</div>
<div class="line">The great increase of Coaches and of Boats,</div>
<div class="line">Shall finde their number more than e’r they were</div>
<div class="line">By halfe and more within these thirty yeeres.</div>
<div class="line">Then watermen at Sea had service still,</div>
<div class="line">And those that staid at home had worke at will:</div>
<div class="line">Then upstart Helcart-Coaches were to seeke,</div>
<div class="line">A man could scarce see twenty in a weeke,</div>
<div class="line">But now I thinke a man may daily see,</div>
<div class="line">More than the Whirries on the <i>Thames</i> can be.</div>
<div class="line">When Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> came to the Crowne,</div>
<div class="line">A Coach in <i>England</i>, then was scarcely knowne,</div>
<div class="line">Then ’twas as rare to see one, as to spy</div>
<div class="line">A Tradesman that had never told a lye.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It will be seen from the first of these lines, that a
difference is made between the coach and the caroche
(carroch or carroache). On this point there is a definite
statement in the Elizabethan play <i>Tu Quoque</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Prepare yourself to like this gentleman,</div>
<div class="line">Who can maintain thee in thy choice of gowns,</div>
<div class="line">Of tires, of servants, and of costly jewels;</div>
<div class="line">Nay, for a need, out of his easy nature,</div>
<div class="line">May’st draw him to the keeping of a coach</div>
<div class="line">For country, and carroch for London.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, too, is borne out by the speech of Lady Eitherside
already quoted. Many servants were needed for the
carroch. Massinger speaks of one being drawn by six
Flanders mares, and having its coachman, groom,
postilion, and footman, to look after it. “These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
carroaches,” says Croal<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> “were larger and clumsier”
than the coaches, “but were considered more stately.”
Taylor speaks of the town Vehicle as “a mere Engine
of Pride,” and gives a rather ludicrous account of some
common women who had hired one of them to go to
“the Greene-Goose faire at <i>Stratford</i> the <i>Bowe</i>.” The
occupants of this carroch “were so be-madam’d, be-mistrist,
and Ladified by the beggers, that the foolish
Women began to swell with a proud Supposition or
Imaginary greatnes, and gave all their mony to the
mendicanting Canters.”</p>

<p>Poor Taylor! He felt very deeply on the question
of these new coaches which were to put an end once and
for all time to his trade. He must have felt that Henry
of Navarre’s assassination in 1610 would never have
taken place but for that monarch’s affection for his
coach; yet in spite of his deep hatred, he was once
prevailed upon to ride inside one of them. “It was
but my chance” he records, “once to bee brought from
Whitehall to the Tower in my Master Sir William
Waades Coach, and before I had been drawn twenty
yardes, such a Timpany of Pride puft me up, that I was
ready to burst with the winde chollicke of vaine-glory.
In what state I would leane over the boote, and looke,
and pry if I saw any of my acquaintance, and then I
would stand up vailing my Bonnet.”</p>

<p>It almost looks as though he had enjoyed his ride!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>UST as the horse-litter gave way before the coach,
so the coach, not long after its appearance, found a
serious rival in the man-drawn litter or Sedan
chair. When or where this chair came from, or
who brought it into use once again, is not known. That
Sedan itself was the first place to adopt this chair may
be true&mdash;the analogy already mentioned holding good&mdash;but
beyond a few half-serious words in a curious
seventeenth-century pamphlet to be quoted in a little,
there is no positive evidence whatever. Several writers,
indeed, assert that Sedan had nothing to do with the
chair for ever associated with its name, but in that
tantalising manner which is unfortunately characteristic
of former times, omit to state their reason. It has been
suggested that <i>sedan</i> was the name of the cloth with
which the chair was lined, but if this were so, the cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
most probably took its name from the chair it adorned.
But wherever it was first made it is reasonable to suppose
that the narrowness of the streets made a smaller
vehicle than either coach or horse-litter convenient.</p>

<p>The earliest chair, other than those ancient <i>lecticæ</i> and
φορεῖα mentioned in the first chapter, appears to have
belonged to the Emperor Charles V, in the first half of
the sixteenth century. This, indeed, does bear some
resemblance to the common conception of a <i>chair</i>, but
the first Sedans of some fifty years later resembled
nothing so much as a modern dog-kennel provided with
two poles. A more unsociable apparatus was surely
never built, and yet its almost immediate popularity is
easily explained. With the urban streets not yet properly
paved and the eternal jolting of the coach, to the accompaniment
of such a clatter as must have made speech
almost impossible, anything in the nature of a conveyance
that made at once for physical comfort and comparative
silence would have been favourably received.</p>

<p>There is mention of a chair being shown in England
in 1581&mdash;just at the time when the country was beginning
to show an interest in carriages&mdash;but it was not until
after the death of Elizabeth that such a novelty was
seen in the streets of London. You are not wholly
surprised, moreover, to hear that the innovation was due
to Buckingham, that apostle of luxury, who probably
first saw the chair on his visit to Spain with Prince
Charles. Indeed the Prince is supposed to have brought
back three of them with him.</p>

<p>At first, of course, there was opposition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Every new thing the People disaffect,” wrote Arthur
Wilson, the historian, “They stumble sometimes, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>the <i>action</i> for the <i>person</i>, which rises like a little <i>cloud</i>
but soon after vanishes. So after, when <i>Buckingham</i>
came to be carried upon Men’s shoulders the <i>clamour</i>
and the <i>noise</i> of it was so extravagant that the People
would rail on him in the Streets, loathing that Men
should be brought to as servile a condition as Horses.
So irksome is every little new impression that breaks an
old <i>Custom</i> and rubs and grates against the <i>public humour</i>.
But when Time had made these Chairs common, every
loose <i>Minion</i> used them, so that that which got at first
so much scandal was the means to convey those privately
to such places where they might give much more. Just
like <i>long hair</i>, at one time described as abominable, at
another time approved as beautiful. So various are the
<i>fancies</i> of the <i>times</i>!”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is to be noticed that Buckingham, according to
this account, was carried upon men’s shoulders. This
was the case at first, but such a mode was speedily
changed for that of hand-poles&mdash;at once safer and more
comfortable for the occupant, and certainly more convenient
for the men.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>John Evelyn disagrees with Wilson and ascribes the
introduction of the chair into England to Sir Saunders
Duncombe, a Gentleman-Pensioner knighted by James I
in Scotland in 1617, who enjoyed Buckingham’s patronage.
In his Diary for 1645, he writes of the Neapolitans:
“They greatly affect the Spanish gravity in their
habit; delight in good horses; the streets are full of
gallants on horseback, in coaches and sedans, from
hence brought first into England by Sir Saunders
Duncombe.” Undoubtedly Duncombe was responsible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>for the great popularity of the chair in England, and
for a time held a monopoly in such chairs as could be
had for hire, but it may be that Buckingham suggested
this monopoly in the first place, after the temporary
opposition to their use had been overcome. Which
rather suggests that Spain was actually the first country
where they were used, though this is mere conjecture.</p>

<p>In the meantime much was happening to the coaches.
They were increasing enormously in number, not only
those privately owned, but also those hired out by the
day. These latter soon became known as hackney-coaches.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
They seem to have been put on the streets
as early as 1605, but “remained in the owner’s yards
until sent for.” In 1633 the Strand was chosen as the
first regular stand for such coaches by a Captain Bailey,
one of the pioneers of the movement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I cannot omit to mention,” writes Lord Stafford,
“any new thing that comes up amongst us though ever
so trivial. Here is one Captain Bailey, he hath been a
sea captain, but now lives on land about this city where
he tries experiments. He hath erected, according to
his ability, some four hackney coaches, put his men in
livery and appointed them to stand at the Maypole in
the Strand, giving them instructions at what rate to
carry men into several parts of the town where all day
they may be had. Other hackney men veering this
way, they flocked to the same place and performed their
journeys at the same rate, so that sometimes there is
twenty of them together, which dispose up and down,
that they and others are to be had everywhere, as watermen
are to be had at the waterside. Everybody is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>much pleased with it, for whereas before coaches could
be had but at great rate”&mdash;one recalls the prices paid
by Lord Rutland a few years before&mdash;“now a man may
have one much cheaper.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of these coaches that were put on to the streets
seem to have been old and disused carriages belonging
to the quality. Many of them still bore noble arms,
and, indeed, it would seem that when the hackneys
were no longer disused noblemen’s carriages, the proprietors
found it advisable to pretend that they were.
Nearly every hansom and four-wheeled cab at the end
of the nineteenth century bore some sort of coronet on

<p>The drivers of these first hackneys wore large coats
with several capes, one over the other, for warmth.
London, however, seems to have been the only town in
which they were to be seen. “Coaches,” wrote Fynes
Morison in 1617, “are not to be hired anywhere but in
London. For a day’s journey a coach with two horses
is let for about 10s. a day, or 15s. with three horses,
the coachman finding the horses’ feed.” From the
same author it would appear that most travellers still
doggedly kept to their horses, and indeed, in some
counties a horse could be hired for threepence a day, an
incredibly small sum. “Carriers,” he also records,
“have long covered waggons in which they carry passengers
too and fro; but this kind of journeying is
very tedious; so that none but women and people of
inferior condition travel in this sort.” These were the
stage-waggons which in due course gave rise to the
stage-coaches, which in their turn were superseded by
the mail-coaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>A similar movement in France gave rise to the <i>fiacres</i>,
so called from the sign of St. Fiacre, which adorned one
of the principal inns in Paris, in front of which the
public coaches stood. In Scotland, too, one Henry
Andersen, a native of Pomerania, had in 1610 been
granted a royal patent to provide public coaches in
Scotland, and for some years ran a service between
Edinburgh and Leith. England had yet to follow
Andersen’s example, but the hackneys were increasing
so rapidly in London that in 1635 a proclamation was
issued to suppress them. And it is to be noticed that
Taylor’s diatribes were directed more particularly against
these public conveyances than against the privately
owned carriages, which, after all, could hardly affect
his trade. The proclamation was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That the great numbers of Hackney Coaches of late
time seen and kept in London, Westminster, and their
Suburbs, and the general and promiscuous use of
Coaches there, were not only <i>a great disturbance to his
Majesty, his dearest Consort the Queen, the Nobility, and
others of place and degree, in their passage through the
Streets</i>; but the Streets themselves were so pestered,
and the pavements so broken up, that the common
passage is thereby hindered and more dangerous; and
the prices of hay and provender and other provisions of
stable, thereby made exceeding dear: Wherefore We
expressly command and forbid, That, from the feast of
St. John the Baptist next coming, no Hackney or
Hired Coach, be used or suffered in London, Westminster,
or the Suburbs or Liberties thereof, excepting
they be to travel at least three miles out
of London or Westminster, or the Suburbs thereof.
And also, that no person shall go in a Coach in the
said Streets, except the owner of the Coach shall con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>stantly
keep up Four able Horses for our Service, when
required.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is dated January 19th, 1635/6, and must have had
a considerable, if temporary, effect, for as Samuel Pegge
points out in his unfinished manuscript on the early use
of coaches<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> it could not “operate much in the King’s
favour, as it would hardly be worth a Coach-master’s
while to be at so great a contingent charge as the keeping
of four horses to be furnished at a moment’s warning
for His Majesty’s occasional employment.”</p>

<p>It was then that Sir Saunders Duncombe obtained his
monopoly, and, of course, everything was in his favour.
The actual patent granted to him belongs to the previous
year, but the two are approximately contemporary.
From a letter written in 1634 to Lord Stafford, it appears
that Duncombe had in that year forty or fifty chairs
“making ready for use.” Possibly the whole thing was
worked up by Buckingham and his satellites. Duncombe’s
patent gave the enterprising knight the right
“to put forth and lett for hire” the new chairs for a term
of fourteen years. In his petition he had explained that
“in many parts beyond the seas, the people there are
much carried in the Streets in Chairs that are covered;
by which means very few Coaches are used amongst
them.” And so Duncombe was allowed to “reap some
fruit and benefit of his industry,” and might “recompense
himself of the costs, charges, and expences” to
which he had, or said he had, been put.</p>

<p>For two years these covered chairs held the advantage,
and indeed seem to have been exceedingly popular.
There is a most amusing pamphlet, which I have already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>mentioned, “printed by Robert Raworth, for John
Crooch,” in 1636, entitled <i>Coach and Sedan pleasantly disputing
for Place and Precedence, the Brewer’s Cart being
Moderator</i>. It is signed “Mis-amaxius,” and is dedicated
“to the Valorous, and worthy all title of Honor, S<sup>r</sup>
Elias Hicks.” “Light stuffe,” the author calls it, and
tells us that he is “no ordinary Pamphleteer ...
onely in Mirth I tried what I could doe upon a running
subject, at the request of a friend in the <i>Strand</i>: whose
leggs, not so sound as his Judgement, enforce him to
keepe his Chamber, where hee can neither sleepe or
studie for the clattering of <i>Coaches</i>.” It is an interesting
little production, both for its own whimsicalities and
for the sidelights it affords into the town’s views on the
subject of vehicles at the time. It starts with the cuckoo
warning the milkmaids of Islington to get back to
<i>Finsburie</i>. The writer, accompanied by a Frenchman
and a tailor, walks back to the city, and in a narrow
street comes across a coach and a sedan quarrelling about
which of them is to “take the wall.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Wee perceived two lustie fellowes to justle for the
wall, and almost readie to fall together by the eares, the
one (the lesser of the two) was in a suite of greene after
a strange manner, windowed before and behind with
<i>Isen-glasse</i>, having two handsome fellowes in greene
coats attending him, the one went before, the other came
behind; their coats were lac’d down the back with a
greene-lace sutable, so were their halfe sleeves, which
perswaded me at first they were some cast suites of their
Masters; their backs were harnessed with leather cingles,
cut out of a hide, as broad as <i>Dutch</i>-collops of <i>Bacon</i>.</p>

<p>“The other was a thick burly square sett fellow, in a
doublet of Black-leather, Brasse-button’d down the brest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>Backe, Sleeves, and winges, with monstrous wide bootes,
fringed at the top, with a net fringe, and a round breech
(after the old fashion) guilded, and on his back-side an
Atcheivement of sundry Coats in their propper colors,
quarterd with Crest, Helme and Mantle, besides here
and there, on the sides of a single Escutchion or crest,
with some Emblematicall <i>Word</i> or other; I supposed,
they were made of some Pendants, or Banners, that had
beene stollen, from over some Monument, where they
had long hung in a Church.</p>

<p>“Hee had onely one man before him, wrapt in a red
cloake, with wide sleeves, turned up at the hands, and
cudgell’d thick on the backe and shoulders with broad
shining lace (not much unlike that which Mummers
make of strawe hatts) and of each side of him, went a
Lacquay, the one a French boy, the other Irish, all sutable
alike: The <i>Frenchman</i> (as I learned afterward)
when his Master was in the Countrey, taught his lady
and his daughter <i>French</i>: Ushers them abroad to publicke
meetings, and assemblies, all saving the Church
whither shee never came: The other went on errands,
help’d the maide to beate Bucks, fetch in water, carried
up meate, and waited at the Table.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The writer attempts mediation, and his offer is favourably
received. The combatants explain who they are. The
burly fellow speaks first:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My name Sir (quoth hee) is <i>Coach</i>, who am a Gentleman
of an anciente house, as you may perceive by my
so many quarter’d coates, of <i>Dukes</i>, <i>Marquises</i>, <i>Earles</i>,
<i>Viscounts</i>, <i>Barons</i>, Knights, and Gentlemen, there is never a
Lord or Lady in the land but is of my acquaintance; my
imployment is so great, that I am never at quiet, day or
night; I am a Benefactor to all Meetings, Play-houses,
Mercers shops, Taverns, and some other houses of
recreation.... This other that offers me the wrong,
they call him Mounsier <i>Sedan</i>, some Mr. <i>Chair</i>, a Greene-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>goose
hatch’d but the other day ... and whereas hee
is able with all the helpe and furtherance hee can make
and devise, to goe not above a mile in an houre; as
grosse as I am, I can runne three or foure in halfe an
houre; yea, after dinner, when my belly is as full as it
can hold (and I may say to you) of dainty bitts too.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Whereupon the sedan chimes in:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Sir, the occasion of our difference was this: Whether
an emptie Coach, that has a Lords head painted
Coate and Crest, as Lion, Bull, Elephant, &amp;c. upon it
without, might take the wall of a <i>Sedan</i> that had a
knighte alive within it.” I confess, he goes on to say, I
am “a meere stranger, till of late in <i>England</i>; therefore,
if the Law of Hospitalitie be observed (as <i>England</i> hath
beene accounted the most hospitable kingdome of the
World,) I ought to be the better entertained, and used,
(as I am sure I shall) and find as good friends, as Coach
hath any, it is not his bigge lookes, nor his nimble tongue,
that so runnes upon wheeles, shall scare mee; hee shall
know that I am above him both in esteeme, and dignitie,
and hereafter will know my place better.... Neither,
I hope, will any thinke the worse of mee, for that I am
a Forreiner; hath not your Countrey Coach of England
been extreemly enriched by strangers?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, all your luxuries, he continues, are foreign,
your perfumes are Italian, and your perukes made in
France.</p>

<p>For some time it seems that Sedan is getting the best
of it. Whereas the coach, he argues, has to wait out in
the cold streets often for hours at a time, he is many
times admitted into the privacy of my Lady’s chamber,
where he is rubbed clean both within and without.
“And the plain troath is,” he concludes, “I will no
longer bee made a foole by you ... the kenell is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
naturall walke.” At this moment a carman appears and
supports the sedan. Coaches, he says, keep the town
awake, endanger the lives of children, and, particularly
in the suburbs, “be-dash gentlemen’s gowns.” There
then follows a curious piece of dialogue between Sedan
and Powel, a Welshman, one of his attendants:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Sedan.</i> We have our name from <i>Sedanum</i>, or <i>Sedan</i>,
that famous Citie and Universitie, belonging to the
Dukes of <i>Bevillon</i>, and where hee keepes his Court.”</p>

<p>“<i>Powel.</i> Nay, doe you heare mee Master, it is from
<i>Sedanny</i>, which in our British language, is a brave, faire,
daintie well-favoured Ladie, or prettie sweete wench,
and wee carrie such some time Master....”</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the morning is wasted by such desultory
talk, and the street becomes blocked. There comes
on the scene a waterman, who, of course, is equally
antagonistic to both, and would throw coach and sedan
into the Thames if he were not afraid of blocking the
stream, and so bringing harm to himself. There follows
him a country farmer, who thinks the sedan the honester
and humbler of the two, but really knows very little
about it. “I heare no great ill of you,” he is good
enough to say, but is bound to add, “I have had no
acquaintance with your cowcumber-cullor’d men.” Yet
in the country he has in his way tried a sedan-chair,
which is a “plaine wheele-barrow,” just as his cart is
his coach “wherein now and then for my pleasure I
ride, my maides going along with me.” But if they
both come to Lincolnshire, the sedan, he thinks, will
receive a warmer welcome than the coach.</p>

<p>After him comes a country vicar who has no hesitation
in accusing the coach of all sorts of robberies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Soon, he cries, you will be “turned off.” You never
cared for church, and indeed, during service, you disturb
everybody rumbling your loudest outside. Also
you are so set up that you will never give place “either
to cart or carre.” A surveyor is less personal than
the vicar, but has little good to say of the coach, although
he agrees with most of the others that for a
nobleman of high rank, it is something of a necessity.</p>

<p>Finally the brewer appears and speedily puts an end
to the wrangle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“With that, comes up unto us a lustie tall fellow,
sitting betweene two mōstrous great wheeles, drawne
by a great old jade blinde of an eie, in a leather pilch,
two emptie beere-barrels upon a brewer’s slings besides
him, and old blew-cap all bedaub’d, and stincking with
yest.... My name is <i>Beere-cart</i>, quoth hee, I came
into England in <i>Henry</i> the Seventh’s time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And the decision of the cart is, of course, that both
coach and sedan shall give way to <i>him</i>. They are both
to exercise great care, and the sedan is to have the wall.
And he adds, turning to the smaller vehicle, a sentence
which it is difficult to understand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You shall never,” he says, “carrie Coachman againe,
for the first you ever carried was a Coachman, for which
you had like to have sufferd, had not your Master beene
more mercifull.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Such quarrels were very frequent, not only at this
time, but right on through the eighteenth century.
Swift in one of his letters to Stella mentions an accident
due to the carelessness of a chairman. “The chairman
that carried me,” he says, “squeezed a great fellow
against a wall, who wisely turned his back, and broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
one of the side glasses in a thousand pieces. I fell a
scolding, pretended I was like to be cut to pieces, and
made them set down the chair in the Park, while they
picked out the bits of glasses: and when I paid them,
I quarrelled still, so they dared not grumble, and I came
off for my fare: but I was plaguily afraid they would
have said, God bless your honour, won’t you give us
something for our glass?”</p>

<p>Swift was the author of an amusing satire on the same
subject, wherein coach and sedan were no better friends
than of old.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>By this time, however, many changes in the chairs
had taken place. They seem to have been introduced
into Paris in 1617 by M. de Montbrun, though unfortunately
from whence this gentleman brought them we
are nowhere informed. They were called <i>chaises à
porteurs</i>. Possibly English and French chairs were at
first quite similar to each other in appearance&mdash;square
boxes with a pent-house&mdash;but in the middle of the century&mdash;in
Paris, at any rate, they became far more
elegant in form, and began to be ornamented and richly
upholstered. Some of them resembled, in shape, the
body of the modern hansom-cab. This was particularly
the case with a new carriage, introduced about 1668,
called the <i>brouette</i> (wheelbarrow), <i>roulette</i>, or <i>vanaigrette</i>,
which was merely a sedan upon two wheels. It was
drawn in the usual way by a man, and was an early
form of that vehicle which still survives in the East as
the jin-rick-shaw. The brouette held but one person,
its wheels were large, and its two poles projected some
way in front. One Dupin was apparently the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
person to manufacture them, and after his first experiments
he applied “two elbow-springs beneath the front,
and attached them to the axle-tree by long shackles, the
axle-tree working up and down in a groove beneath
the inside-seat.” This improvement is of more than
ordinary interest in so far as it is the first mention of
steel springs to carriages. In the ordinary coaches these
steel springs were first applied beneath the bottom of
the body. They were probably formed out of a single
piece of metal.</p>

<p>In the case of the brouette there was the usual
opposition&mdash;this time from the proprietors of the ordinary
sedans&mdash;but although a temporary prohibition was
made, the brouette triumphed, and in 1671 was a common
sight in the streets of Paris. It was not very
suitable for decoration. As one French writer remarks,
it was enough if the machine were solidly constructed.
The brouette had windows at the sides and a small
support in front of the wheels to allow the carriage to
maintain its proper position when not held up by an
attendant.</p>

<p>The brouette does not seem to have come immediately
to England, though in the eighteenth century
there was a <i>sedan cart</i>, similar in appearance to it, to be
seen in London. On the other hand, the ordinary
sedans were rapidly gaining in popularity, and maintained
that popularity right through the reigns of the
first three Georges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<p class="caption"><i>Neapolitan Sedan Chair</i><br /><i>Early Sixteenth Century</i><br />(<i>At South Kensington</i>)</p></div>

<p>In appearance they became rather more graceful
towards the middle of the century, though less so in
later days. The public chairs were generally made of
black or dark green leather, ornamented with gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>“beading,” the frame and roof, which had a double
slope, being of wood, as was also the small square
window-frame. Private chairs, however, could be as
gorgeous as the owner pleased, though in this respect
continental chairs far surpassed our own. At Paris
are shown two magnificent chairs which belonged to
Louis XV.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These,” says Croal, “have glass windows in side and
front, through which the sumptuous lining of crimson
velvet is discernible. The outside is beautifully painted
and gilt, and though now somewhat faded, the splendour
of the vehicles can be imagined, even in their decay.
The gorgeously attired king within, or it might be the
queen or some reigning favourite, would be attended
by a gay escort of gentlemen of the court, with a crowd
of bearers and lacqueys, not to speak of armed guards,
whose liveries probably equalled in grandeur the courtly
habits of the greater men who surrounded the royal
chair.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At South Kensington a private English chair of about
1760 is shown, “rather handsomely ornamented in
ormolu, the sides being divided into four panels, but
without windows. In form,” continues Croal, “the
chair may be described as ‘carriage-bodied,’ not being,
as the later chairs, square at the bottom. At the two
front corners heavy tassels are hung, and through the
door in front it can be seen that the interior lining is of
figured damask. The bearing rings through which the
poles passed are of brass.” This, however, cannot
compare with an Italian nobleman’s large conveyance of
the early eighteenth century which shows a profusion
of gold filigree work on the roof that calls to mind
nothing so strongly as a Buszard wedding-cake. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
belonged to a member of the Grand Ducal family of
Tuscany, by whom it was used on baptismal occasions.
Here, besides the gilt work on the roof, there is a
medallion-painting of figures in antique costume over
the door. The walls are painted a pale French grey
“with elaborately carved mouldings round the panels,
with groups of flowers painted in the middle. The
interior is lined with satin corresponding to the painting
outside, being in gold and colours upon a pale
ground.”</p>

<p>The chairmen do not seem to have been a particularly
agreeable lot of fellows. In London they were generally
Irish or Welsh. They were often drunk, often
careless, and nearly always uncivil. Says Gay:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In Edinburgh, however, where there were ninety
chairs in 1738, the chairmen were Highlanders and
rather more civil. “An inhabitant of Edinburgh,”
says Hugh Arnot in his history of that city (1789),
“who visits the metropolis can hardly suppress his
laughter at seeing the awkward hobble of a street chair
in the city of London.” We learn from Markland
that in 1740 a chair in Edinburgh could be hired for
four shillings a day or twenty shillings a week.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> In
London, according to George Selwyn, you could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>carried three miles for a shilling.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> In Edinburgh, again,
where chairs were used at a later date than anywhere in
England, rules were made for the public convenience in
1740, the most interesting of these being one which
forbade a soldier in the service of the city guard to
carry a chair at any time. By 1789 their numbers had
increased to 238, including fifty privately owned.</p>

<p>Scattered mention of them occurs amongst British
authors. Steele, in one of his <i>Tatler</i> papers, proposes
to levy a tax upon them, and regrets that the sumptuary
laws of the old Romans have never been revived.
The chairmen, or “slaves of the rich,” he says, “take
up the whole street, while we Peripatetics are very glad
to watch an opportunity to whisk across a passage, very
thankful that we are not run over for interrupting the
machine, that carries in it a person neither more handsome,
wise, nor valiant, than the meanest of us.”</p>

<p>Matthew Bramble in <i>Humphrey Clinker</i> is made to
draw a wretched picture of the chairs which abounded
in Bath at the middle of the century:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The valetudinarian,” he writes, “is carried in a
chair, betwixt the heels of a double row of horses,
wincing under the curry-combs of grooms and postilions,
over and above the hazard of being obstructed or overturned
by the carriages which are continually making
their exit or their entrance. I suppose, after some
chairmen shall have been maimed, and a few lives lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>by those accidents, the corporation will think in earnest
about providing a more safe and commodious passage....
If, instead of the areas and iron rails, which seem
to be of very little use, there had been a corridor with
arcades all round, as in Covent Garden, the appearance
of the whole would have been more magnificent and
striking; those arcades would have afforded an agreeable
covered walk, and sheltered the poor chairmen and
their carriages from the rain, which is here almost perpetual.
At present the chairs stand soaking in the
open street from morning to night, till they become so
many boxes of wet leather, for the benefit of the gouty
and rheumatic, who are transported in them from place
to place. Indeed, this is a shocking inconvenience, that
extends over the whole city; and I am persuaded it
produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm.
Even the close chairs, contrived for the sick, by standing
in the open air, have their fringe linings impregnated,
like so many sponges, with the moisture of the atmosphere.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was to Bath that Princess Amelia was carried in
a sedan by eight chairmen from St. James’s, in April,
1728. This must easily have been the longest, and, so
far as the chairmen were concerned, the most wearisome
journey ever performed by a chair.</p>

<p>John Wilkes mentions in one of his letters to his
daughter that he ascended Mont Cenis in a chair
“carried by two men and assisted by four more.”
“This,” he says, “was not a sedan chair, but a small
wicker chair with two long poles; there is no covering
of any kind to it.” Such open chairs seem to have been
very uncommon, and were, I imagine, unknown in
England. Some, however, had more glass than others,
and their size fluctuated. Fashionable ladies must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>have found a difficulty in getting into a public chair of
the ordinary size at the time of the large hoop petticoat,
and there is a satiric print, dated 1733, which shows
a lady thus attired, being hauled out through the opened
roof of one with ropes and pulleys. Similarly, when
forty or fifty years later the head-dress of the women
became so enormous, a ludicrous print appeared showing
a patent arrangement whereby the roof of a chair could
be raised on rods to as great a height as was required.</p>

<p>In general the roof opened upwards, being hinged at
the back. This is clearly shown in a print published in
1768, called <i>The Female Orators</i>, in which a clergyman
is stepping out of his chair, and the chairmen very
obviously demanding their fare. Another print published
about 1786, called the <i>Social Pinch</i>, shows a very
famous chairman, Donald Kennedy, offering his “mull”
to Donald Balack, a native of Ross-shire, whom he had
just set down. Here the structure of the public chair
in use at this date is clearly shown.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, however,
the chair as a mode of conveyance was on the wane.
Fenimore Cooper in his <i>Sketches of English Society</i>
(1837) was able to write: “Sedan chairs appear to have
finally disappeared from St. James’ Street. Even in
1826 I saw a stand of them that has since vanished.
The chairs may still be used on particular occasions, but
were Cecilia now in existence, she would find it difficult
to be set down in Mrs. Benfield’s entry from a machine
so lumbering.” Which suggests that the chair had not
only degenerated in numbers, but also in appearance.
They had become larger and uncouth in Cooper’s day.
One is reminded of that chair in <i>Pickwick</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
“having been originally built for a gouty gentleman
with funded property, would hold Mr. Pickwick and
Mr. Tupman at least as comfortably as a modern post-chaise.”
Yet so late as 1775 the popularity of the
chair had been at its highest. It was the old story.
With the new century were coming new ideas. The
chair slowly and quite naturally was dropping out of
existence.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh, as I have said, it lingered on for
rather a longer time. In 1806 stringent regulations
were still required. Those chairs which maintained
their stand at night had to have “a light fixed on the
fore part of one of the poles.” On the occasion of a
fire or a mob the chairmen had to hurry to the scene of
excitement, and there await the magistrate’s orders.
They were not allowed to charge more than ninepence
a mile, seven-and-six a day, or a guinea and a half
a week. Such rates, too, continued to be set out in the
<i>Edinburgh Almanac</i> until 1830. After that comes an
ominous silence. By that time only the private chair
was in use.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lady Don,” says Lord Cockburn in his <i>Memorials</i>,
“was about the last person (so far as I recollect) in
Edinburgh, who kept a private sedan chair. Hers
stood in the lobby and was as handsome and comfortable
as silk, velvet, and gilding could make it. And
when she wished to use it two well-known respectable
chairmen, enveloped in her livery cloaks, were the envy
of her [superannuated] brethren. She and Mrs.
Rochead both sat in Tron Church; and well do I
remember how I used to form one of the cluster that
always took its station to see these beautiful relics
emerge from coach and chair.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>The time, indeed, had come when the sight of a chair
was as much a public entertainment as it had been when
Buckingham had been borne through the streets “on
men’s shoulders.”</p>

<p>Yet although they so rapidly disappeared off the face
of Europe, in Asia they lost little of their popularity,
and in many places to-day are the only methods of conveyance
in common use. China, in particular, had long
been a land of sedans. John Barrow in his <i>Collection of
Authentic, Useful, and Entertaining Voyages and Discoveries</i>,
1765, mentions the fact that at an early date the Chinese
“small covered carriages on two wheels, not unlike in
appearance to our funeral hearses, but only about half
their length,” had been superseded by chairs. To a
European, he relates, this was hardly surprising, as the
carriage was anything but comfortable, and required you
to sit on your haunches at the bottom&mdash;“the most
uneasy vehicle that can be imagined.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘The Chinese,’ records another eighteenth-century
traveller, ‘occasionally travel on horseback, but their best
land conveyance by far is the sedan, a vehicle which certainly
exists among them in perfection. Whether viewed
with regard to lightness, comfort, or any other quality
associated with such mode of carriage, there is nothing
so convenient elsewhere. Two bearers place upon their
shoulders the poles, which are thin and elastic and in
shape something like the shafts of a gig, connected near
the ends, and in this manner they proceed forward
with a measured step in an almost imperceptible motion,
and sometimes with considerable speed. Instead of
panels, the sides and back of the chair consist of woollen
cloth for the sake of lightness with a covering of oilcloth
against rain. The front is closed with a hanging
blind of the same materials in lieu of a door, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>circular aperture of gauze to see through.... Private
persons among the Chinese are restricted to two bearers,
ordinary magistrates to four, and the viceroys to eight,
while the Emperor alone is great enough to require
sixteen.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>There is further mention of these Chinese chairs in
Oliphant’s much later account of Lord Elgin’s mission.
Lord Elgin himself travelled in a chair of the kind
usually reserved for mandarins of the highest rank,
which was larger than those in ordinary use and had a
fine brass knob on the top. Eight bearers carried it.
In processions a <i>hwakeaou</i> or flowered chair was often
used.</p>

<p>Japan, too, had early had sedans both for travelling
and for more purely ceremonial purposes. Light bamboo
chairs, they were, called <i>kangoes</i> or <i>norimons</i>, which were
borne by two or more persons. On the introduction
of the European coach, however, a kind of brouette,
as I have said, was substituted, and in a few years there
were hundreds of thousands of these <i>jin-rick-shaws</i> on
the streets, not only in Japan, but throughout Asia.
At first many of these were grotesquely adorned, but
their appearance is too well-known at the present day
for need of a lengthy description. Equipped with “every
modern convenience” and very well built indeed, they
afford a European a delightful sensation on his first ride,
even though he may have visions of those earlier days
of his youth when he was carried about in a similar way
(though at a less speed) in the homely perambulator.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE seventeenth century saw great changes in
vehicular design. In 1660 the first <i>berlin</i>
was made. Steel springs, as we have seen,
appeared a few years later in the brouette.
About this time, too, a hooded gig or <i>calèche</i> made its
appearance in the streets of Paris, the first of many
carriages to be built upon entirely new lines. Glass
windows and complete doors were used in the coaches,
both public and private, which became smaller, more
compact, and certainly more graceful. Improvements
were not confined to one country, but proceeded simultaneously
not only in various European countries, but
also in South America. Roads, too, were improved, and
laws for the regulation of traffic framed with some
regularity and effect.</p>

<p>John Evelyn in his Diary gives interesting glimpses
of such carriages and other vehicles as he saw during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
several European tours. In Brussels (1641) he was
allowed the use of Sir Henry de Vic’s coach and six,
and travelled luxuriously in it as far as Ghent. “On
the way,” he notes, “I met with divers little waggons,
prettily contrived, and full of peddling merchandize,
drawn by mastiff dogs, harnessed completely like so
many coach-horses; in some four, in others six, as in
Brussels itself I had observed. In Antwerp I saw, as I
remember, four dogs draw five lusty children in a
chariot.” When dogs were first used for the purpose of
traction does not appear, but they are still to be seen in
the Netherlands in a like capacity. A few days later, to
continue with Evelyn’s observations, he was going from
Ostend to Dunkirk “by waggon ... the journey being
made all on the sea sands.” On his return to England,
however, it is to be noticed that he rode post to Canterbury.
In 1643 he was again in Paris, mentioning “the
multitude of coaches passing every moment over the
bridge,” this being, he says, to a new spectator, “an
agreeable diversion.” In the following year, while
standing in the garden of the Tuileries, he saw “so
many coaches as one would hardly think could be maintained
in the whole city, going late as it was, towards
the course”&mdash;the fashionable rendezvous of the day&mdash;“the
circle being capable of containing a hundred
coaches to turn commodiously, and the larger of the
plantations for five or six coaches abreast.” The road
from Paris to Orleans he describes as “excellent.”
Coming to Italy, he found Milan, in spite of the narrowness
of its streets, abounding in rich coaches. In Paris
again, two or three years afterwards, the design of a
new coach so took his fancy that he determined, like his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
friend Mr. Pepys, to possess one for himself. And so
on May 29th, 1652, “I went,” he writes, “to give
orders about a coach to be made against my wife’s
coming, being my first coach, the pattern whereof I
brought out of Paris.” This was probably “booted,”
but differed from the earlier coaches in having a curved
roof.</p>

<p>The commonest French coach of this time seems to have
been the <i>corbillard</i>, a flat-bottomed, half-open, half-close
coach, furnished with curtains of cloth or leather in the
front part. These were merely tied on to the supports,
and would roll up when required. Doors there were
none, but there was a “movable rail, over which a
leather screen was hung” at the back portion of the
carriage, which was about six feet long, and here were
the seats. There were also projecting movable step-seats.
Possibly Evelyn saw a newer model with a
curved bottom and door half-way up, panelled in the
lower part, but curtained above. Such a carriage was
hung low, and would have swung from side to side,
giving such passengers as were “bad sailors” a fit of
nausea.</p>

<p>The English-designed coaches of this time, though
without glass windows, were almost completely enclosed,
and, compared with the new <i>chariots</i>, which were just
upon making their appearance, of a huge size. In many
of them three people could sit abreast, and seven or
eight find room for themselves. In 1641 when Charles I
passed through London on his return from Scotland, his
was the only coach in the royal procession, but seven
people, including His Majesty, were driving, apparently
in comfort, within it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>The Commonwealth produced no new carriage,
although isolated experiments were already being made.
Cromwell himself was wont to drive his own coach and
six “for recreation-sake” in Hyde Park, then as now a
fashionable resort.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When my Lord Protector’s coach,” wrote Misson, a
Frenchman then on a visit to England, “came into the
Park with Colonel Ingleby and my Lord’s three daughters,
the coaches and horses flocked about them like some
miracle. But they galloped (after the mode court-pace
now) round and round the Park, and all that great multitude
hunted them and caught them still at the turn like
a hare, and then made a lane with all reverent haste for
them, and so after them again, and I never saw the like
in my life.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Cromwell’s desire to play coachman once led to an
accident which might have been serious. The particulars
are given in a letter from the Dutch Ambassador to
the States-General, dated October 16th, 1654:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“His Highness, only accompanied with secretary
Thurloe and some few of his gentlemen and servants,
went to take the air in Hyde Park, when he caused
some dishes of meat to be brought, when he had his
dinner; and afterwards had a mind to drive the coach
himself. Having put only the secretary into it,” he
whipped up “those six grey horses, which the Count of
Oldenburgh had presented unto His Highness, who
drove pretty handsomely for some time. But at last,
provoking these horses too much with the whip, they
grew unruly and ran so fast that the postillion could not
hold them in, whereby His Highness was flung out of
the coach upon the pole.... The secretary’s ankle
was hurt leaping out, and he keeps his chamber.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>“From this,” comments Sir Walter Gilbey, who
quotes the letter, “it is evident that when six horses
were used a postillion rode one of the leaders and controlled
them; while the driver managed the wheelers
and middle pair. When four horses were driven,” he
continues, “it was the custom to have two outriders,
one to ride at the leaders’ heads, and one at the two
wheelers’. In town this would be merely display, but
on a journey the outriders’ horses might replace those
of the team in case of accident, or, more frequently, be
added to them to help drag the coach over a stretch of
bad road.”</p>

<p>It is just possible that this coach which was overturned
by Cromwell’s faulty driving is at present in
existence, repaired, of course, and redecorated, and,
incidentally, painted by Cipriani, as Mr. Speaker’s
coach. This undoubtedly belongs to the period, and
one writer actually commits himself to the statement
that the two are identical. A commoner report assigns
the Speaker’s coach in the first place to Lenthall, Cromwell’s
Speaker. Whatever be its history, the coach is a
fine example of Jacobean work. It is of carved oak,
the body being hung upon leather braces. The workmanship,
Mr. Oakley Williams thinks,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> is Flemish.
Cipriani’s work, added late in the eighteenth century, is
still in good preservation. Five people can comfortably
sit inside. “The Speaker,” says Mr. Williams, “presumably
occupied the seat of honour alone. Opposite
him sat his Chaplain and the Sergeant-at-Arms. For
the accommodation of his other attendants ... a low
bench is arranged across the floor of the coach, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>a semicircular space for the legs of its occupants
scooped out against either door”&mdash;relic, of course, of the
boot. “The coach,” he continues, after mentioning
that the Speaker always has his own arms painted on
the side of the body, and is allowed an escort of a single
Lifeguardsman, “weighs two tons one hundredweight
and several pounds, yet for all its size it so beautifully
hung and balanced that an able-bodied man was able without
undue effort to draw it out for my inspection. Its
coach-house is one of the vaults in the inner courtyard
of the House of Lords.” Both origin and subsequent
history of this coach, however, are wrapped in an impenetrable
mystery.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s mishap naturally gave the Royalist writers
an opportunity for satire. Cleveland wrote the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div></div>

<p>Evelyn met with a similar mishap, but fortunately
escaped injury. He, too, was accustomed to ride in
Hyde Park, and on one occasion is grumbling that
“every coach” there “was made to pay a shilling, and a
horse sixpence, by a sordid fellow who had purchased it
of the State, as they called it.”</p>

<p>Such experiments as were being made in this country
were in the direction of a safer and swifter vehicle than
those in general use. So early as 1625, one Edward
Knapp had been granted a patent for “hanging the
bodies of carriages on springs of steel.” Apparently
Knapp was wholly unsuccessful, but forty years later
Colonel Blunt, working upon similar lines, produced
several carriages which, if not entirely satisfactory in
themselves, led the way towards a wider appreciation of
the problems in question. If, as seems probable, he
was identical with the Blunt or Blount of Wicklemarsh,
near Blackheath (afterwards Sir Harry Blount), who had
travelled extensively in Turkey and elsewhere, it may be
that he had brought back with him several continental
curiosities. We hear, indeed, of a French chariot in
his possession. In 1657 the Colonel was making experiments
with a “way-wiser” or “adometer” which
exactly “measured the miles ... showing these by an
index as we went on. It had three circles, one pointing
to the number of rods, another to the miles, by 10 to
1000, with all the subdivisions of quarters; very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
pretty,” opines Evelyn, “and useful.” This seems to
have been the first instrument of the kind, and is overlooked
by Beckmann in his account of such contrivances.
The Colonel’s work was brought to the
notice of the newly formed Royal Society, and a committee
was formed to investigate it. The first model
shown to this committee was of “a chariot with four
springs, esteemed by him very easy both to the rider
and the horse, and at the same time cheap.” The
Committee also examined the designs of Dr. Robert
Hooke, a distinguished member of the Society, and
Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, who “produced
the model of a chariot with two wheels and short
double springs to be driven by one horse; the chair of
it being so fixed upon two springs that the person sitting
just over or rather a little behind the axle-tree was, when
the experiment was made at Colonel Blunt’s house,
carried with as much ease as one could be in the French
chariot without at all burthening the horse.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Dr. Hooke
showed “two drafts of this model having this circumstantial
difference&mdash;one of these was contrived so that
the boy sitting on a seat made for him behind the chair
and guiding the reins over the top of it, drives the
horse. The other by placing the chair behind and the
saddle on the horse’s back being to be borne up by the
shafts, that the boy riding on it and driving the horse
should be little or no burden to the horse.”</p>

<p>The Colonel continued experimenting both with the
older coaches and a new light chariot. In 1665 Mr.
Pepys was taken to see an improvement of his on a
coach.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“I met my Lord Brouncker, Sir Frederick Murrey,
Dean Wilkins, and Mr. Hooke, going by coach to
Colonel Blunt’s to dinner.... No extraordinary dinner,
nor any other entertainment good; but afterwards to
the tryal of some experiments about making of coaches
easy. And several we tried; but one did prove mighty
easy, not here for me to describe, but the whole body of
the coach lies upon one long spring, and we all, one after
another, rid in it; and it is very fine and likely to take.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A few months later Pepys saw the new chariot itself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“After dinner comes Colonel Blunt in his new chariot
made with springs; as that was of wicker, where in a
while since we rode at his house. And he hath rode, he
says, now his journey, many miles in it with one horse,
and out-drives any coach, and out-goes any horse, and so
easy he says. So for curiosity, I went into it to try it,
and up the hill [Shooter’s Hill] to the heath [Blackheath],
and over the cart ruts, and found it pretty well, but not
so easy as he pretends.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Colonel persevered. At the beginning of the
next year the Royal Society’s committee met again at his
house to consider, says Pepys, “of the business of
chariots, and to try their new invention, which I saw
here my Lord Brouncker ride in: where the coachman
sits astride upon a pole over the horse, but do not touch
the horse, which is a pretty odde thing; but it seems it
is most easy for the horse, and, as they say, for the man
also.”</p>

<p>Others were also at work upon carriage improvement,
and in 1667 the Royal Society “generally approved” of
a chariot invented by a Dr. Croune. “No particulars of
the vehicle are given,” says Sir Walter Gilbey, “we
are only told that ‘some fence was proposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
made for the coachman against the kicking of the horse.’”
In the same year, Sir William Pen possessed a light
chariot in which Pepys drove out one day. This, he
says, was “plain, but pretty and more fashionable in
shape than any coaches he hath, and yet do not cost him,
harness and all, above £32.”</p>

<p>All such experiments were undoubtedly in the direction
of a light, swift carriage, such as was built about
1660 in Germany by Philip de Chiesa, a Piedmontese,
in the service of the Duke of Prussia. Indeed, it is quite
possible that Colonel Blunt either possessed, or had seen,
one of de Chiesa’s carriages, which were none other than
the famous and popular <i>berlins</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>So far Germany had been taking the lead. Her State
coaches were the most wonderful in the world, and
her coachbuilders were designing lesser coaches for the
ordinary folk. But the <i>berlin</i> was the first of these lesser
carriages to catch the public fancy, and enjoy more than
a local success. Now the <i>berlin</i> differed in the first place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>from previous carriages in having two perches instead of
the single pole, “and between these two perches, from
the front transom to the hind axle-bed, two strong leather
braces were placed, with jacks or small windlasses, to
wind them up tighter if they stretched.” The bottom
of the coach was no longer flat, and these braces of
leather allowed the body to play up and down instead of
swinging from side to side as before. Here, then, you
had an entirely new principle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the Imperial mews at Vienna,” says Thrupp,
“are four coach berlins, which, I think, may belong
to this period. They are said to have been built for the
Emperor Leopold who reigned at Vienna from 1658
to 1700, and Kink describes this Emperor’s carriage as
covered with red cloth and as having glass panels; he
also says they were called the Imperial glass coaches. It
is possible that the coaches have been a little altered
from the time of their construction, but I consider that
in these four we have the oldest coaches with solid doors
and glasses all round that exist in Europe. Whether
they are identical with the Emperor Leopold’s wedding-carriages
matters much less than the influence the <i>berlin</i>
undoubtedly had upon the coach-building of that period.
It was the means of introducing the double perch, which,
although it is not now in fashion, was adopted for very
many carriages both in England and abroad, up to 1810.
Crane-necks to perches were suggested by the form of
the <i>berlin</i> perch; and as bodies swinging from standard
posts suggested the position of the C spring, so bodies
resting upon long leather braces suggested the horizontal
and elbow springs to which we owe so much. The first
<i>berlin</i> was made as a small <i>vis-à-vis</i> coach&mdash;small
because it was to be used as a light travelling carriage,
and narrow because it was to hang between the two
perches, and was only needed to carry two persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>inside. It was such an improvement in lightness and
appearance upon the cumbersome coaches that carried
eight persons, that it at once found favour, and was
imitated in Paris and still more in London.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These early <i>berlins</i> were not nearly so gorgeous as
the heavier coaches which they gradually supplanted.
Red cloth and black nails had taken the place of the gilt
ornamentation and crimson hangings of the previous
generation.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Only on festivals, we learn, the black
harness “was ornamented with silk fringe.” The
coaches used by the Emperor himself had leather traces,
but the ladies of his suite had to be content with
carriages the traces of which were made of rope.</p>

<p>The glass windows which were such a conspicuous
feature of the <i>berlins</i>, were also used in the larger
coaches, finally, as I have said, eliminating the boot.
Mr. Charles Harper thinks that the first English coach
to possess them belonged in 1661 to the Duke of York.
At first these windows seem to have caused trouble,
and there is the ludicrous incident mentioned by Pepys,
of my Lady Peterborough who “being in her glass-coach
with the glass up and seeing a lady pass by in a
coach whom she would salute, the glass was so clear
that she thought it had been open, and so ran her head
through the glass!” Lady Ashly did not like the new
invention, because, as she said, the windows were for
ever flying open while the coach was running over a bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>piece of road. Lady Peterborough’s misfortune was
tribute indeed to the maker!</p>

<p>In this matter of the glass it would seem that Spain
had taken the lead, and it is quite possible that Spain
invented the first two-seated chariots. In 1631, thirty
years before the first <i>berlin</i> was made, an Infanta of
Spain is reported to have traversed Carinthia “in a glass-carriage
in which no more than two persons could sit.”
What this was like we do not know. It may have had
rude springs, and been built from the common coach
models to a smaller measurement; it was certainly
bootless, and framed glass or mica took the place of
curtains. In France the first coaches to have glass
windows, according to M. Roubo, created something of
a Court scandal in the time of Louis XIII. The glass,
he says, was first used in the upper panels of the doors,
but was soon extended to the whole of the upper half
of the sides and front of the body, so making of the
carriage literally a glass-coach.</p>

<p>You may learn more of the English seventeenth-century
carriages from Pepys than from any other
writer; nor is this a matter for wonder. Pepys had a
knack of knowing just exactly what posterity would
desire to know. From his Diary, we learn incidentally
that the watermen were still endeavouring to regain
their lost prestige and custom, but by this time coaches
had enormously increased in number&mdash;in 1662 there
were nearly 2500 hackneys in London alone&mdash;and
thenceforth they are hardly heard of. To be any one,
moreover, you had to have your private coach.
Doctors, for instance, found it very well worth their
while to keep a coach, though, as Sir Thomas Browne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
told his son, they were certainly “more for state than
for businesse.” On the other hand those who were
well able to keep a private carriage occasionally preferred
the use of a hackney, and sometimes at times
when they had no business to do so. Mr. Pepys, with
clear ideas upon the dignity and responsibilities of rank,
was indignant at any such foolery. He was told, he
recalls in one place, “of the ridiculous humour of our
King and Knights of the Garter the other day, who,
whereas heretofore their robes were only to be worn
during their ceremonies and service, these, as proud of
their coats, did wear them all day till night, and then
rode into the Park with them on. Nay, and he tells us
he did see my Lord Oxford and Duke of Monmouth
in a hackney-coach with two footmen in the Park, with
their robes on; which is a most scandalous thing, so as
all gravity may be said to be lost amongst us.”</p>

<p>The private coach, too, was the last luxury to be
given up after financial embarrassment. So we have
Lady Flippant, in Wycherley’s <i>Love in a Wood</i>, saying,
“Ah, Mrs. Joyner, nothing grieves me like the putting
down my coach! For the fine clothes, the fine lodgings,&mdash;let
’em go; for a lodging is as unnecessary a
thing to a widow that has a coach, as a hat to a man
that has a good peruke. For, as you see about town,
she is most probably at home in her coach:&mdash;she eats,
and drinks, and sleeps in her coach; and for her visits,
she receives them in the playhouse.” No lady’s virtue,
according to this cynical dramatist, was proof against a
coach and six.</p>

<p>At the time of the introduction of the light, two-seated
chariots, ordinary private coaches were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
changing in shape. In Charles I’s reign they had been
both very long and very wide; in his son’s time they
became much slenderer and less unwieldy. Alterations
in this direction were possibly suggested by the ubiquitous
and most convenient sedans, and, indeed, there is
an allusion to this change of shape in Sir William
Davenant’s <i>First Day’s Entertainment at Rutland House</i>,
in which, during a dialogue between a Russian and a
Londoner, the foreigner says: “I have now left your
houses, and am passing through your streets; but not
in a coach, for they are uneasily hung, and so narrow
that I took them for sedans upon wheels.”</p>

<p>Stage-coaches, however, remained just as huge and
just as gorgeous as ever. They were built, more particularly
in Italy, in the old fashion&mdash;unenclosed and
curtained. Count Gozzadini describes a State coach
built in 1629 for the marriage of Duke Edward Farnese
with the Lady Margaret of Tuscany, and as we shall see
in a moment, this differed only in the details of its
ornamentation from the State coach in which Lord
Castlemaine made his public entry into Rome sixty
years later.</p>

<p>The body of the Farnese coach, says Gozzadini,
“was lined with crimson velvet and gold thread, and
the woodwork covered with silver plates, chased and
embossed and perforated, in half relief. It could carry
eight persons, four on the seats attached to the doors,
and four in the back and front. The roof was supported
by eight silver columns, on the roof were eight silver
vases, and unicorns’ heads and lilies in full relief projected
from the roof and ends of the body here and
there. The roof was composed of twenty sticks, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>verging
from the edge to the centre, which was crowned
with a great rose with silver leaves on the outside, and
inside by the armorial bearings of the Princes of Tuscany
and Farnese held up by cupids. The curtains of the
sides and back of the coach were of crimson velvet,
embroidered with silver lilies with gold leaves. At the
back and front of the coach-carriage were statues of
unicorns, surrounded by cupids and wreathed with
lilies, grouped round the standards from which the
body was suspended; on the tops of the standards
were silver vases, with festoons of fruit, and wraught
in silver. In the front were also statues of Justice and
Mercy, supporting the coachman’s seat. The braces
suspending the body were of leather, covered with
crimson velvet; the wheels and pole were plated with
polished silver. The whole was drawn by six horses,
with harness and trappings covered with velvet, embroidered
with gold and silver thread, and with silver
buckles. It is said that twenty-five excellent silversmiths
worked at this coach for two years, and used up
25,000 ounces of silver; and that the work was superintended
by two master coachbuilders, one from Parma
and the other from Piacenza.” Lord Castlemaine’s procession
into Rome contained three hundred and thirty
coaches, of which thirteen were his own property; and
of these two were State coaches. These likewise were
not properly enclosed, and had no glass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They were hung,” says Thrupp, “inside and out,
with beautifully embroidered cloths, the one coach with
crimson, the other with azure-blue velvet, and gold and
silver work. The roofs were adorned with scroll work
and vases gilt; under the roof were curtains of silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>fringes, and the ambassador’s armorial bearings. The
carriage of the principal coach was adorned in front
with two large Tritons, of carved wood, gilt all over,
that supported a cushion for the coachman between
them, and from their shoulders the braces depended.
The footboard was formed by a conch shell, between
two dolphins. In the rear of the coach were two more
Tritons, supporting not only the leather braces of the
coach, but two other statues of Neptune and Cybele,
who in turn held a royal crown. Below Neptune and
Cybele, and projecting backwards, were a lion and a
unicorn, and several cupids and wreaths of flowers.
The wheels had moulded rims, and the spokes were
hidden by curving foliage carving. The second coach
had plainer wheels and fewer statues about it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>They may have been magnificent, but they were certainly
not very beautiful. Much the same, too, might
be said of those coaches in which foreign ambassadors
made their public entry into London. In 1660 Evelyn
saw the Prince de Ligne, Ambassador-Extraordinary
from Spain, make a splendid entry with seventeen
coaches, and a month later Pepys was watching “the
Duke de Soissons go from his audience with a very
great deal of state: his own coach all red velvet covered
with gold lace, and drawn by six barbes, and attended by
twenty pages very rich in cloths.”</p>

<p class="tb">In this year, 1660, there was a proclamation against
the excessive number of hackney-coaches, and two years
later Commissioners were appointed “for reforming the
buildings, ways, streets and incumbrances, and regulating
the hackney-coaches in the city of London.” Of
this body Evelyn was sworn a member in May, 1662.
Pepys, however, never found any difficulty in obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
one when he desired, and, indeed, of late years, pressure
of business had made a hackney-coach an almost daily
necessity. Finally, he found it cheaper to possess one
of his own, and the story of this coach is particularly
interesting, and may be told in some detail.</p>

<p>Long ago, Mr. Pepys had dreamt of owning a private
coach. “Talking long in bed with my wife,” he writes
on March 2nd, 1661-2, “about our frugal life for the
time to come, proposing to her what I could and would
do, if I were worth £2000, that is, be a knight, and
keep my coach, which pleased her.” Times were bad,
however, and although Pepys enjoyed many a ride in a
friend’s coach and witnessed Colonel Blunt’s experiments,
the great idea did not mature. But one of his
particular friends, Thomas Povey, M.P., who had been
a colleague of his on the Tangier committee, himself
the owner of at least one coach, seems to have kept
Pepys’s ambitions astir. This was more especially the
case in 1665, at which time Mr. Povey had purchased
one of the new and already fashionable chariots. This
excited Pepys’s admiration. “Comes Mr. Povey’s
coach,” he records, “and so rode most nobly, in his
most pretty and best-contrived chariot in the world,
with many new contrivances, his never having till now,
within a day or two, been yet finished.” Povey was
something of an inventor himself. Evelyn calls him a
“nice contriver of all elegancies, and most formal.”
The necessary money was apparently not forthcoming
for a year or two, but in April, 1667, Pepys had a
mind “to buy enough ground to build a coach-house
and stable; for,” says he, “I have had it much in my
thoughts lately that it is not too much for me now, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
degree or cost, to keep a coach, but contrarily, that I
am almost ashamed to be seen in a hackney.” Accordingly,
Mr. Commander, his lawyer, was bidden to look
for a suitable piece of ground. The idea had now
taken definite shape, and Pepys was committed. “I
find it necessary,” he says, “for me, both in respect of
honour and the profit of it also, my expence in Hackney
coaches being now so great, to keep a coach, and therefore
will do it.” The next entry shows the first of his
disappointments:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Commander tells me, after all, that I cannot
have a lease of the ground for my coach-house and
stable, till a lawsuit be ended. I am a little sorry,
because I am pretty full in my mind of keeping a
coach; but yet,” he adds philosophically&mdash;the date was
June 4th, 1667&mdash;“when I think of it again, the Dutch
and French both at sea, and we poor, and still out of
order, I know not yet what turns there may be.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So the summer passed, and “most of our discourse,”
he admits, “is about our keeping a coach the next year,
which pleases my wife mightily; and if I continue as
able as now, it will save me money.” At the beginning
of the new year Will Griffin was ordered to make fresh
inquiries about the most necessary coach-house, but
nothing seems to have been done until the autumn.
Then Pepys, more or less it would seem on the spur of
the moment, chose a coach for himself, and immediately
disliked it. No one seems to have given him the same
advice. Some ladies, for instance, Mrs. Pepys amongst
them, preferred the large old-fashioned coaches. Others
wanted the latest thing from Paris. Says Mrs. Flirt in
<i>The Gentleman Dancing-Master</i>: “But take notice, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
have no little, dirty, second-hand chariot, new furnished,
but a large, sociable, well-painted coach; nor will I keep
it till it be as well-known as myself, and it comes to be
called Flirt-coach.” Her friend, Monsieur Paris, shrugs
his shoulders. “’Tis very well,” says he, “you must
have your great, gilt, fine painted coach. I’m sure they
are grown so common already amongst you that ladies
of quality begin to take up with hackneys again.” It
was felt, no doubt, that fashion in carriages as in everything
else would speedily change. Mr. Pepys must
have found considerable difficulty in making up his
mind. The new chariots were small, light and, so far
as he knew, most fashionable; but possibly they were
not quite to his taste, and equally possibly they might
not be fashionable in ten years’ time. Also they perhaps
lacked the solid dignity of the older carriages, and were
less likely to attract public attention&mdash;two important
considerations. In the end, however, he seems to have
chosen a large coach of the old style. Mr. Povey saw
it, and poor Pepys knew at once that a dreadful mistake
had been made.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He and I ... talk of my coach,” runs the Diary
for 30th October, “and I got him to go and see it, where
he finds most infinite fault with it, both as to being out
of fashion and heavy, with so good reason, that I am
mightily glad of his having corrected me in it; and so
I do resolve to have one of his build, and with his
advice, both in coach and horses, he being the fittest
man in the world for it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly on the following Sunday, “Mr. Povey
sent his coach for my wife and I to see, which we liked
mightily, and will endeavour to have him get us just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
such another.” Mr. Povey thought that his own coachmaker
had a replica for sale. Pepys thereupon went
down into the neighbourhood of Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
found the man, but learnt to his disgust that the coach
had been sold that very morning. At the end of the
week, however, in company with his friend, he “spent
the afternoon going up and down the coachmakers in
Cow Lane, and did see several, and last did pitch upon
a little chariott, whose body was framed, but not covered,
at the widow’s, that made Mr. Lowther’s fine coach; and
we are mightily pleased with it, it being light, and will
be very genteel and sober; to be covered with leather,
but yet will hold four. Being much satisfied with this,
I carried him to White Hall. Home, where I give my
wife a good account of the day’s work.”</p>

<p>Having bought the coach, it was necessary to complete
the arrangements about a coach-house, and in the
same week Pepys fared forth again for the purpose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This afternoon I did go out towards Sir D. Gauden’s,
thinking to have bespoke a place for my coach and
horses, when I have them, at the Victualling Office; but
find the way so bad and long that I returned, and looked
up and down for places elsewhere, in an inne, which I
hope to get with more convenience than there.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This not proving satisfactory, Sir Richard Ford was
persuaded to lend his own coach-yard. Then follow in
quick succession the other entries:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>28th November, 1668.</i>&mdash;All the morning at the
Office, where, while I was sitting, one comes and
tells me that my coach is come. So I was forced
to go out, and to Sir Richard Ford’s, where I spoke
to him, and he is very willing to have it brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>in, and stand there: and so I ordered it, to my great
content, it being mighty pretty, only the horses do
not please me, and, therefore, resolve to have better.”</p>

<p>“<i>29th November.</i>&mdash;This morning my coachman’s
clothes come home and I like the livery mightily....
Sir W. Warren ... tells me, as soon as he saw my coach
yesterday, he wished that the owner might not contract
envy by it; but I told him it was now manifestly for my
profit to keep a coach, and that, after employments like
mine for eight years, it were hard if I could not be
thought to be justly able to do that.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>“<i>30th November.</i>&mdash;My wife after dinner, went abroad
the first time in her coach, calling on Roger Pepys, and
visiting Mrs. Creed, and my cozen Turner. Thus ended
this month, with very good intent, but most expenseful
to my purse on things of pleasure, having furnished my
wife’s closet and the best chamber, and a coach and
horses, that ever I knew in the world; and I am put
into the greatest condition of outward state that ever I
was in, or hoped ever to be, or desired; and this at
a time when we do daily expect great changes in this
office; and by all reports we must, all of us, turn out.”</p>

<p>“<i>2nd December.</i>&mdash;Abroad with my wife, the first time
that ever I rode in my own coach, which do make my
heart rejoice, and praise God, and pray him to bless it to
me and continue it.”</p>

<p>“<i>3rd December.</i>&mdash; ... and so home, it being mighty
pleasure to go alone with my poor wife, in a coach of our
own, to a play, and makes us appear mighty great, I think,
in the world; at least, greater than ever I could, or my
friends for me, have once expected; or, I think, than
ever any of my family ever yet lived, in my memory,
but my cozen Pepys in Salisbury Court.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>4th December.</i>&mdash;I carried my wife ... to Smithfield,
where they sit in the coach, while Mr. Pickering,
who meets me at Smithfield and I, and W. Hewer and
a friend of his, a jockey did go about to see several
pairs of horses, for my coach; but it was late, and we
agreed on none, but left it to another time: but here I
do see instances of a piece of craft and cunning that
I never dreamed of, concerning the buying and choosing
of horses.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There were plenty of horses to be had, it seems, but
either Mr. Pepys did not like them or he was afraid of
being cheated. “Up and down,” he is recording a week
or so later, “all the afternoon about horses, and did see
the knaveries and tricks of jockeys. At last, however,
we concluded upon giving £50 for a fine pair of black
horses we saw this day se’nnight; and so set Mr.
Pickering down near his house, whom I am much beholden
to, for his care herein, and he hath admired
skill, I perceive, in this business, and so home.” So
the horses were changed, and for a while Mr. Pepys
was obliged to revert to the despised hackney, his
“coachman being this day about breaking of my horses
to the coach, they having never yet drawn.” Towards
the end of the month the new horses were ready, and
their master made his first ride behind them on a visit
to the Temple, though later in the day he was again
using the old pair, “not daring yet to use the others
too much, but only to enter them.” Then, before the
new year, came the first mishap.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Up, and vexed a little to be forced to pay 40s. for
a glass of my coach, which was broke the other day,
nobody knows how, within the door, while it was down;
but I do doubt that I did break it myself with my knees.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning of February another misfortune is
recorded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Just at Holborn Circuit the bolt broke, that holds
the fore-wheels to the perch, and so the horses went away
with them, and left the coachman and us; but being near
our coachmaker’s and we staying in a little ironmonger’s
shop, we were presently supplied with another.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Accidents of this kind were continually happening.
Glasses smashed, bolts broke, and, what seems incredible,
doors were lost! Even so late as 1710, a
reward of 30s. was offered for a lost door. “Lost,”
runs this remarkable advertisement, “the side door of
a Chariot, painted Coffee Colour, with a Round Cipher
in the Pannel, Lin’d with White Cloath embos’d with
Red, having a Glass in one Frame, and White Canvas
in another, with Red Strings to the Frames.”</p>

<p>To return to Pepys. In a month or two another
matter connected with his coach was occupying his
attention. There were some people who did not think
that a man in the comparatively humble position of
Secretary to the Admiralty had any right to possess
a coach, even though, in its owner’s estimation, it might
be “genteel and sober.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To the Park,” he is recording in April, “my wife
and I; and here Sir W. Coventry did first see me and
my wife in a coach of our own; and so did also this
night the Duke of York, who did eye my wife mightily.
But I begin to doubt that my being so much seen in my
own coach at this time, may be observed to my prejudice,
but I must venture it now.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was no idle fear, for in a while there was printed
an ill-written and scurrilous pamphlet called <i>Plane Truth</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
<i>or Closet Discorse betwixt Pepys and Hewer</i>, in which the
following passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is one thing more you must be mightily sorry
for with all speed. Your presumption in your coach in
which you daily ride as if you had been son and heir to
the great Emperor Neptune, or as if you had been infallibly
to have succeeded him in his government of the
Ocean, all which was presumption in the highest degree.
First, you had upon the fore-part of your chariot, tempestuous
waves and wrecks of ships; on your left hand,
forts and great guns, and ships a fighting; on your right
hand was a fair harbour and galleys riding, with their
flags and pennants spread, kindly saluting each other,
just like P[epys] and H[ewer&mdash;his chief clerk].”</p></blockquote>

<p>How far Pepys’s carriage was decorated is not known,
though this description does not tally in the least with
Pepys’s own. In any case, he took no notice of such
attacks, and so far from making his coach less conspicuous,
arranged to have it newly painted and varnished.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>19th April, 1669.</i>&mdash;After dinner out again, and,
calling about my coach, which was at the coachmaker’s,
and hath been there for these two or three days, to be
new painted, and the window-frames gilt against next
May-day, went on with my hackney to White Hall.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A few days later he gave orders for some “new sort
of varnish” to be used on the standards at a cost of
forty shillings, this being in his view very cheap.
Indeed, “the doing of the biggest coach all over,” he
learnt, “comes not above £6.” On his next visit to the
coachmaker, he was surprised to find several great ladies
“sitting in the body of a coach that must be ended tomorrow
... eating of bread and butter and drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
ale.” His own coach had been silvered over, “but no
varnish yet laid on, so I put it in a way of doing.” A
few hours later he called back again,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“and there vexed to see nothing yet done to my coach,
at three in the afternoon; but I set it in doing, and
stood by till eight at night, and saw the painter varnish
it which is pretty to see how every doing it over do
make it more and more yellow: and it dries as fast in
the sun as it can be laid on almost; and most coaches
are, now-a-days, done so, and it is very pretty when laid
on well, and not too pale, as some are, even to show the
silver. Here I did make the workmen drink, and saw
my coach cleaned and oyled.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And so eager was he to have it without delay that his
coachman and horses were sent to fetch it that very
evening, and on the following gala day, May 1st,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“we went alone through the town with our new liveries
of serge, and the horses’ manes and tails tied with red
ribbons, and the standards gilt with varnish, and all
clean, and green reines, the people did mightily look upon
us; and, the truth is, I did not see any coach more
pretty, though more gay, than ours all the day. But
we set out, out of humour&mdash;I because Betty, whom I
expected, was not come to go with us; and my wife
that I would sit on the same seat with her, which she
likes not, being so fine: and she then expected me to
meet Sheres, which we did in Pell Mell, and against my
will, I was forced to take him into the coach, but was
sullen all day almost, and little complaisant; the day
being unpleasing, though the Park full of coaches, but
dusty and windy, and cold, and now and then a little
dribbling of rain; and what made it worse, there were
so many hackney-coaches as spoiled the sight of the
gentlemen’s; and so we had little pleasure.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>Henceforth Mr. Pepys, in spite of sundry warnings
from his friend Mr. Povey and others, continued to use
his coach, and although perhaps as he grew older, his
coach was less brilliantly adorned, there seems no reason
to suppose that he ever regretted its purchase.</p>

<p class="tb">Though it is not my intention to speak in any detail
of public conveyances, a word must be said here of the
stage-coaches,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> which made their appearance on English
roads in 1640. These were large coaches, leather-curtained
at first&mdash;glass does not seem to have been
used until 1680&mdash;and capable of seating six or eight
passengers. Their chief feature was the huge basket
strapped to the back.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is of late,” says Chamberlayne in his well-known
<i>Present State of Great Britain</i> (1649), “such an
admirable commodiousness both for men and women,
to travel from London to the principal towns in the
country, that the like hath not been known in the world;
and that is by stage-coaches, wherein one may be transported
to any place sheltered from foul weather and
foul ways, free from endangering of one’s health and
one’s body by hard jogging or over-violent motion on
horseback; and this not only at the low price of about
a shilling for every five miles, but with such velocity
and speed in an hour as the foreign post can make but
in one day.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, there was opposition to these public
coaches. In 1662, when there was not a round dozen
of them, one writer was already exhorting their extinction
on the ground that simple country gentlemen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>their simple country wives could now come to London
without due occasion, and there learn all the vice and
luxury that were rampant. So in 1673, in a singular
production called <i>The Grand Concern of England</i>, amongst
the many proposals set forth for the country’s good,
was one “that the Multitude of Stage Coaches and
Caravans be suppressed.” One or two pamphlets of
no particular interest appeared, both for and against
these coaches, but it may be sufficient here to observe
that they steadily increased in numbers and maintained
their existence until the mail-coaches finally superseded
them.</p>

<p>One other public carriage of this time also deserves
mention. This was the <i>carosse à cinq sous</i>, which appeared
in the streets of Paris in 1662. The history of this
primitive omnibus is well told by Mr. Henry Charles
Moore.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The leading spirits in this enterprise were the Duc
de Rouanès, Governor of Poitou, the Marquis de
Sourches, Grand Prévôt, the Marquis de Crenan, Grand
Cup-bearer, and Blaise Pascal, the author of <i>Lettres
Provinciales</i>. The idea was Pascal’s, but not being
sufficiently wealthy to carry it out unaided, he laid the
matter before his friend the Duc de Rouanès, who
suggested that a company should be formed to start the
vehicles. Pascal consented to this being done, and the
Duc set to work at once to prevail upon members of
the aristocracy to take shares in the venture.” After
obtaining a royal decree, “seven vehicles to carry eight
passengers each, all inside, were built, and on March 18th,
1662, they began running. The first one was timed
to start at seven o’clock in the morning, but an hour or
two earlier a huge crowd had assembled to witness the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>inauguration ceremony, which was performed by two
Commissaires of the Châtelet, attired in their official
robes. Accompanying them were four guards of the
Grand Prévôt, twenty men of the City Archers, and a
troop of cavalry. The procession, on arriving at the
line of route, divided into two parts, one Commissaire
and half of the attendants proceeded to the Luxembourg,
and the others to the Porte St. Antoine. At the
latter place three of the twopenny-halfpenny coaches
were stationed, the other four being at the Luxembourg.
Each Commissaire then made a speech, in which he
pointed out the boon that <i>carosses à cinq sous</i> would be to
the public, and laid great stress on the fact that they
would start punctually at certain times whether full or
empty. Moreover, he warned the people that the king
was determined to punish severely any person who
interfered with the coaches, their drivers, conductors,
or passengers. The public was also warned that any
person starting similar vehicles without permission would
be fined 3000 francs, and his horses and coaches
confiscated.</p>

<p>“At the conclusion of his address, the Commissaire
commanded the coachmen to advance, and, after giving
them a few words of advice and caution, presented each
one with a long blue coat, with the City arms embroidered
on the front in brilliant colours. Having
donned their livery, the drivers returned to their vehicles
and climbed up to their seats. Then the command to
start was given, and the two vehicles drove off amidst a
scene of tremendous enthusiasm. The first coach each
way carried no passengers&mdash;a very unbusinesslike arrangement&mdash;the
conductor sitting inside in solitary state.
But the next two, which were sent off a quarter of an
hour after the first, started work in earnest, and it need
scarcely be said that there were no lack of passengers.
The difficulty experienced was in preventing people from
crowding in after the eight seats were occupied. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>beginning of every journey the struggle to get into the
coach was repeated, and many charming costumes were
ruined in the crush. Paris, in short, went mad over its
<i>carosses à cinq sous</i>, and the excitement soon spread to
the suburbs, sending their inhabitants flocking to the
city to see the new vehicles. But very few of the
visitors managed to obtain a ride, for day by day the rush
for seats became greater. The king himself had a ride
in one coach, and the aristocracy and wealthy classes
hastened to follow his example, struggling with their
poorer brethren to obtain a seat. Many persons who
possessed private coaches daily drove to the starting-point,
and yet failed to get a drive in one for a week
or two.</p>

<p>“Four other routes were opened in less than four
months, but at last the fashionable craze came to an
end, and as soon as the upper classes ceased to patronise
the new coaches the middle and lower classes found that
it was cheaper to walk than to ride. The result was
that Pascal, who died only five months after the coaches
began running, lived long enough to see the vehicles
travelling to and fro, half, and sometimes quite,
empty.</p>

<p>“For many months after Pascal’s death the coaches
lingered on, but every week found them less patronised,
and eventually they were discontinued. They had never
been of any real utility, and were regarded by the public
much in the same light as we regard a switchback
railway.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And, indeed, it was a century and a half before the
next omnibus was tried.</p>

<p class="tb">So then, at the middle of the century, when heavy
and slow stage-coaches were making their appearance
on the English country roads, and the unsuccessful
<i>carosse à cinq sous</i> was being tried in the streets of Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the success of the <i>berlin</i>, the <i>brouette</i>, and other
chariots, was in process of remodelling men’s ideas upon
the most feasible carriage for town use. The older
coaches, as I have said, were still retained for particular
occasions, and, indeed, continued to be built with more
ornamentation than ever before. The very spokes of
the wheels were decorated, paintings appeared on the
panels, and every inch of the coach made as brilliant as
possible. France in particular possessed carriages of
the most gorgeous possible description. These were
not only entirely gilded over, but in some cases actually
bejewelled. The richest stuffs lined their interiors, and
masters painted their panels. Immense sums were
spent. There is preserved at Toulouse a carriage of
this date which shows most of these features. The
interior “is, or rather was, lined with white brocade
embroidered with a diaper of pink roses, the roof being
lined with the same, while its angles are hidden by
little smiling cupids gilded from top to toe. The
surface of the panels is, or rather was, a piece of opaque
white, exceedingly well varnished, and edged with a
thick moulding of pink roses; the foliage, instead of
being green, was highly gilded and burnished.”</p>

<p>But the ever-increasing traffic rendered necessary a
much smaller vehicle than these monstrosities for
general use, and this led, somewhere about 1670, to
the introduction of the <i>gig</i>. This was a French invention,
which, while no doubt the logical outcome of the
<i>brouette</i>, bore resemblance to the old Roman <i>cisium</i>, and
led ultimately to the cabriolets, once so popular both in
France and England. Certain experiments tending
towards a gig had been made earlier in the century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
with a chair fixed to a small cart. The first successful
gig was a slender, two-wheeled contrivance, “the body
little more than a shell,” says Thrupp, provided with a
hood “composed of three iron hoop-sticks joined in the
middle to fall upwards.” It was the prototype of the
<i>calèche</i> in France, the <i>carriole</i> of Norway, the <i>calesso</i> of
Naples, and the <i>volante</i> of Cuba. Gozzadini describes
one of them as “an affair with a curved seat fixed on
two long bending shafts, placed in front on the back of
the horse and behind upon the two wheels.” They
were introduced into Florence, he says, in 1672, and
“so increased in numbers that in a few years there were
nearly a thousand in the city.” An early gig of this
kind is preserved at South Kensington. It is a forlorn-looking
vehicle. The body is curved, but there is no
hood. The seat is absurdly small and “beneath the
shafts are two long straps of leather and a windlass to
tighten them&mdash;this apparatus was, no doubt, to regulate
the spring of the vehicle to the road travelled
over.”</p>

<p>The gig speedily underwent several minor changes of
form. In France it was known as <i>calèche</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> or <i>chaise</i>, in
England, as <i>calash</i>, <i>calesh</i>, or <i>chaise</i>, in America as <i>shay</i>.
Unfortunately there is small mention of them in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>temporary
writings, and one is left to suppose that for
some time they did not, except in certain cities, prove
serious rivals to the <i>berlins</i> and other four-wheeled
chariots. It may be that the <i>berlin</i> itself was taken as
a model from which these lighter carriages were evolved.
You had first the big double <i>berlins</i> for four people,
then you had a <i>vis-à-vis</i> for two or more persons facing
each other. Later the front part of the carriage would
be cut away for the sake of lightness. When not
covered such a vehicle as this seems to have been
known as a <i>berlingot</i>. Two could travel in these <i>berlingots</i>
sitting side by side, “while a third person might
travel uncomfortably in front on a kind of movable
seat, which was not much patronised; for it was not
only dangerous, but what was much worse in the eyes
of the grand court gentlemen who used them&mdash;ridiculous.”
There was also evolved a smaller and narrower
<i>berlin</i> with the front cut away and capable of holding
only one passenger, called the <i>désobligeante</i>. The bodies
of the ordinary chaises, which seated one or two people,
seem to have differed from those of the older <i>berlins</i> in
being placed partly below the frame. There were no
side doors, but one at the back which opened horizontally.
When and where all such changes were made,
however, it is impossible to say. The accounts, such
as they are, are often contradictory, and the same names
used to describe what are obviously not identical carriages.
But the two-wheeled gig having appeared there
was nothing to prevent improvements of every conceivable
sort or shape, and innumerable hybrid carriages
appeared, some of which are only known by name.</p>

<p>There is mention of a truly remarkable calash which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
was tried in Dublin in 1685. Exactly who the inventor
was is not known, but Sir Richard Bulkeley interested
himself in the experiments, and read a paper on his
carriage before the Royal Society. Evelyn was one of
those who were present on this occasion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Sir Richard Bulkeley,” he says, “described to us a
model of a chariot he had invented which it was not
possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way it was
drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had
performed in that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety;
there were some inconveniences yet to be remedied&mdash;it
would not contain more than one person; was ready to
take fire every few miles; and being placed and playing
on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious
noise, almost intolerable.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is to be deeply regretted that there is no print of
this remarkable carriage, but further details may be
found in a letter, dated May 5th, 1685, from Sir
Richard Bulkeley himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Sir William Petty,” he writes, “Mr. Molyneux,
and I have spent this day in making experiments with a
new invented calesh, along with the inventor thereof;
’tis he that was in London when I was there, but he
never made any of these caleshes there, for his invention
is much improv’d since he came from thence: it is
in all points different from any machine I have ever
seen: it goes on two wheels, carries one person, and is
light enough. As for its performance, though it hangs
not on braces, yet it is easier than the common coach,
both in the highway, in ploughed fields, cross the
ridges, directly and obliquely. A common coach will
overturn, if one wheel go on a superficies a foot and a
half higher than that of the other; but this will admit
of the difference of three feet and a half in height of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>the superficies, without danger of overturning. We
chose all the irregular banks, the sides of ditches to
run over; and I have this day seen it, at five several
times, turn over and over; that is, the wheels so overturned
as that their spokes laid parallel to the horizon,
so that one wheel laid flat over the head of him that
rode in the Calesh, and the other wheel flat under him;
so much I all but once overturned. But what I have
mentioned was another turn more, so that the wheels
were again <i>in statu quo</i>, and the horse not in the least
disordered: if it should be unruly, with the help of
one pin, you disengage him from the Calesh without
any inconvenience. I myself was once overturned, and
knew it not, till I looked up, and saw the wheel flat
over my head; and, if a man went with his eyes shut,
he would imagine himself in the most smooth way,
though, at the same time, there were three feet difference
in the heights of the ground of each wheel. In
fine, we have made so many, and so various experiments,
and are so well satisfied of the usefulness of the invention,
that we each of us have bespoke one; they are
not (plain) above six or eight pounds a-piece.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Why the nobility, gentry, and worthy burgesses of
England, Scotland, and Ireland did not go and do likewise,
history hides from us. There is no further
mention of Sir Richard’s truly remarkable carriage, and
one is left to imagine that some of the Irish roads were
too bad even for its freakish agility.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they were probably superior to
the Scottish roads of the time, even those in the more
civilised southern districts. “It is recorded,” says
Croal, “that in 1678”&mdash;the year after the founding of
the Coach and Coach-Harness Makers’ Company in
London&mdash;“the difficulties in the way of rapid com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>munication
were such that an agreement was made to
run a coach between Edinburgh and Glasgow, a distance
of forty-four miles, which was to be drawn by six
horses, and to perform the journey to Glasgow and
back in six days!”</p>

<p>Cross-country travelling, indeed, was very bad, and
the rough tracks over which the heavy stage-coaches
rumbled along would have proved too much for the
lighter chariots and gigs which were so popular in
town. I may conclude this chapter by quoting an
amusing description of such cross-country travelling at
the end of the century, taken from Sir John Vanbrugh’s
<i>Provoked Husband</i>. A family is going in its private
coach from Yorkshire to London:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Lord Townley.</i> Mr. Moody, your servant; I am glad
to see you in London. I hope all the family is well.</p>

<p><i>John Moody.</i> Thanks be praised, your honour, they
are all in pretty good heart, thof’ we have had a power
of crosses upo’ the road.</p>

<p><i>Lady Grace.</i> I hope my Lady has no hurt, Mr.
Moody.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Noa, an’t please your ladyship, she was never
in better humour: There’s money enough stirring
now.</p>

<p><i>Manly.</i> What has been the matter, John?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, we came up in such a hurry, you mun
think that our tackle was not so tight as it should be.</p>

<p><i>Manly.</i> Come, tell us all: pray how do they travel?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why i’ the auld coach, Measter; and cause
my Lady loves to do things handsome, to be sure, she
would have a couple of cart horses clapt to th’ four old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
geldings, that neighbours might see she went up to
London in her coach and six! And so Giles Joulter
the ploughman rides postilion!</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt3">......</span></p>

<p><i>Lord Townley.</i> And when do you expect them here,
John?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, we were in hopes to ha’ come yesterday,
an’ it had no’ been that th’ owld wheaze-belly horse
tired; and then we were so cruelly loaden, that the two
fore-wheels came crash down at once in Waggon-Rut
Lane; and there we lost four hours ’fore we could set
things to rights again.</p>

<p><i>Manly.</i> So they bring all their baggage with the
coach then?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ay, ay, and good store on’t there is. Why,
my Lady’s gear alone were as much as filled four portmantel
trunks, besides the great deal box that heavy
Ralph and the monkey sit on behind.</p>

<p><i>Lady Grace.</i> Well, Mr. Moody, and pray how many
are there within the coach?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, there’s my Lady and his Worship, and
the young squoire, and Miss Jenny, and the fat lap-dog,
and my lady’s maid Mrs. Handy, and Doll Tripe the
cook; that’s all. Only Doll puked a little with riding
backward, so they hoisted her into the coach-box, and
then her stomach was easy.</p>

<p><i>Lady Grace.</i> Oh! I see ’em go by me. Ah! ha!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Then, you mun think, Measter, there was some
stowage for the belly, as well as th’ back too; such
cargoes of plum cake, and baskets of tongues, and
biscuits and cheese, and cold boiled beef, and then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
case of sickness, bottles of cherry-brandy, plague-water,
sack, tent, and strong beer, so plenty as made the owld
coach crack again! Mercy upon ’em! and send ’em all
well to town, I say.</p>

<p><i>Manly.</i> Ay! and well on’t again, John.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ods bud! Measter, you’re a wise mon; and for
that matter, so am I. Whoam’s whoam, I say; I’m
sure we got but little good e’er we turned our backs
on’t. Nothing but mischief! Some devil’s trick or
other plagued us, aw th’ day lung. Crack goes one
thing: Bawnce goes another. Woa, says Roger. Then
souse! we are all set fast in a sleugh. Whaw! cries
Miss; scream go the maids; and bawl! just as thof’
they were struck! And so, mercy on us! this was the
trade from morning to night.</p>

designed during the earlier decades of the
eighteenth century, although improvements
and small alterations were constantly being
carried out. There is an isolated reference to a <i>sociable</i>
built apparently in Germany, and the <i>four-wheeled chaise</i>,
or <i>chariot à l’Anglaise</i>, which was to be so popular thirty
or forty years later, put in an appearance about this
time. Of the sociable little enough can be said. The
particular carriage mentioned from its small size would
appear to have been built for the royal children. It
was a low-hung, open carriage over a single perch, and
with seats facing each other. The four-wheeled chaise
was a small chariot with a wide window in front.</p>

<p>Gray, writing to his mother in 1739, speaks of the
French chaise in which he was making the grand tour
with Horace Walpole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The chaise,” he writes, “is a strange sort of conveyance,
of much greater use than beauty; resembling
an ill-shaped chariot, only with the door opening before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>instead of the side. Three horses draw it, one between
the shafts, and the other two on each side, on one
of which the postillion rides, and drives too: This
vehicle will upon occasion, go fourscore miles a day,
but Mr. Walpole, being in no hurry, chooses to make
easy journies of it, and they are easy ones indeed; for
the motion is much like that of a sedan, we go about
six miles an hour, and commonly change horses at the
end of it. It is true they are not very graceful steeds,
but they go well, and through roads which they say are
bad for France, but to me they seem gravel walks and
bowling-greens; in short, it would be the finest travelling
in the world, were it not for the inns.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a chaise as Gray describes came to be known as
a <i>diligence</i>, while in England the one-horse chaise was
more frequently spoken of as a <i>one-horse chair</i>. Contemporary
prints of carriages, however, are scarce, and
for the most part show only the larger coaches.</p>

<p>These coaches were of two distinct patterns. There
were the large square coaches of Charles II’s time, but
there was also a new type of coach or chariot which had
a curious backward tilt to the body. From a superficial
examination of such a carriage, it would appear
impossible for the seats to have been horizontal, and,
indeed, one wonders why this form was adopted. The
result of this backward tilt was to leave a space between
the coachman’s box and the carriage-body itself. Here
one of the grooms sat or sprawled as best he could.
Four, five, or even six other grooms stood uncomfortably
huddled together on a seat or slab at the back.
These men must have added considerably to the weight
of the coach, and certainly did not make travelling any
swifter; but how necessary they were is shown by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>letter of the period in which one nobleman’s servant in
London informs another in Essex that my lord is resolved
to set out. The Essex man is bidden to have
“the keepers and persons who know the holes and the
sloughs” ready to meet his lordship “with lanterns and
long poles” to keep the coach on its way. So many
accidents happened even on the shortest journeys that
five or six men were necessary to put the coach aright.
A road, such as we think of one now, simply did not
exist. You had often to drive across fields in tracks
which exceedingly heavy waggons had made. In 1703,
to take another instance, the King of Spain, then in this
country, was journeying from Portsmouth to Windsor.
The difficulties he experienced on that occasion were
recorded by one of the attendants.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We set out at six in the morning to go to Petworth,
and did not get out of the coaches (save only
when we were overturned or stuck fast in the mire)
till we arrived at our journey’s end. ’Twas hard service
for the prince to sit fourteen hours in the coach
that day without eating anything and passing through
the worst ways that I ever saw in my life; we were
thrown but once indeed in going, but both our coach,
which was the leading, and his highnesse’s body-coach
would have suffered very often if the nimble boors of
Sussex had not frequently poised it or supported it with
their shoulders from Goldalmin almost to Petworth;
and the nearer we approached to the Duke’s house the
more unaccessible it seemed to be. The last nine miles
of the way cost us six hours’ time to conquer them, and
indeed we had never done it if our good master had not
several times lent us a pair of horses out of his own
coach, whereby we were enabled to trace out the way for
him.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>After reading such an account, it is difficult to
understand why any one preferred coach to horseback on
a cross-country journey. No wonder Gay was goaded
to ask:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Who can recount the coach’s various harms,</div>
<div class="line">The legs disjointed, and the broken arms?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“In the wide gulph,” he says in another place,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i10">“the shatter’d coach o’erthrown</div>
<div class="line">Sinks with the snorting steeds; the reins are broke,</div>
<div class="line">And from the crackling axle flies the spoke.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet, according to Swift, Gay was not so averse to the
coach in his later years. Writing to him in 1731, the
Dean says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If your ramble was on horseback, I am glad of it on
account of your health; but I know your arts of patching
up a journey between stage-coaches and friends’
coaches: for you are as arrant a cockney as any hosier
in Cheapside.... You love twelve-penny coaches too
well, without considering that the interest of a whole
thousand pounds brings you but half a crown a day.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“A coach and six horses,” he goes on to say in another
letter, “is the utmost exercise you can bear, and this
only when you can fill it with such company as is best
suited to avoid your taste, and how glad would you be
if it could waft you in the air to avoid jolting.”</p>

<p>There is preserved a chariot of this period which is
probably typical of a nobleman’s carriage of the time. It
was built for one of the Bligh family, possibly the first
Lord Darnley, about 1720. It is a small carriage,
curved curiously in a fashion which recalls some of the
French furniture of the period. The body is slung
upon leather braces, there is a single wide perch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
and there are small elbow springs under the body
at the back. It is very elaborately ornamented, and
still keeps some of its pristine magnificence. A curious
point about the Darnley chariot, to which some people
have wrongfully ascribed a much earlier date, is the
length of the door, which reaches nearly a foot below
the bottom of the body. A similar peculiarity is to be
seen in another coach of the period which was built in
1713 for the Spanish representative at the time of the
Peace of Utrecht. Here “the quarters rake towards the
roof considerably, the roof over the doorway is arched
upwards, the upper quarters are filled with large glasses
of mirror plate glass.... The wheels have carved
spokes and felloes.... There is a hammercloth
cushion in front and a footboard supported by Tritons
blowing horns.” Another Spanish coach, with spiral
spokes and similar peculiarities, is preserved at Madrid.
This elongated door seems peculiar to the period and
may have followed upon a desire to hide the steps,
though the lowness of the carriage made more than one
or two of these unnecessary. Many of the Spanish
coaches of this time, by the way, were without the coach-box,
postilions only being employed&mdash;the story being
that a certain Duke of Olivarez found that his coachman
had heard and betrayed a State secret. There was, I
believe, actually a law passed in Spain forbidding coachmen
altogether.</p>

<p>French coaches were very resplendent. “When I
was in France,” writes Addison in one of the earlier
<i>Spectators</i>, “I used to gaze with great Astonishment at
the Splendid Equipages and Party-Coloured Habits, of
that Fantastick Nation. I was one Day in particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
contemplating a Lady, that sate in a Coach adorned with
gilded Cupids, and finely painted with the Loves of
<i>Venus</i> and <i>Adonis</i>. The Coach was drawn by six milk-white
Horses, and loaden behind with the same Number
of powder’d Footmen. Just before the Lady were a
Couple of beautiful Pages that were stuck among the
Harness, and, by their gay Dresses and smiling Features,
looked like the elder Brothers of the little Boys that
were carved and painted in every corner of the Coach.”
The boys “stuck among the harness” obviously were
resting in that space which was made by the back-tilting
of the body.</p>

<p>The Viennese coaches of this time seem to have had
a very great deal of glass about them, but the Turkish
coaches had none. Writing home from Adrianople in
1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Designing to go [to Sophia] <i>incognita</i>, I hired a
Turkish coach. These voitures are not at all like ours,
but much more convenient for the country, the heat
being so great that glasses would be very troublesome.
They are made a good deal in the manner of the Dutch
coaches, having wooden lattices painted and gilded; the
inside being painted with baskets and nosegays of
flowers, intermixed commonly with little poetical
mottoes. They are covered all over with scarlet cloth,
lined with silk, and very often richly embroidered and
fringed. This covering entirely hides the persons in
them, but may be thrown back at pleasure, and the
ladies peep through the lattices. They hold four people
very conveniently, seated on cushions, but not raised.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_178.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="The Darnley Chariot. Early Eighteenth Century" />
<p class="caption"><i>The Darnley Chariot. Early Eighteenth Century</i><br />(<i>From Smith’s “Concise History of English Carriages”</i>)</p></div>

<p>They were, it would seem, mere covered waggons,
and, indeed, in another place Lady Mary speaks of
them as such. Turkey possessed also “open gilded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>chariots,” but in these the women were not allowed to
drive.</p>

<p>Russia, too, at this time possessed coaches, and we
read that Peter the Great in his trans-European journey
travelled with “thirty-two four-horse carriages and
four six-horse waggons.” One or two particulars are
forthcoming of the royal coach-house. It contained but
two coaches, with four places in each, for the use of the
Empress and a smaller, low-hung carriage, painted red,
for the Emperor. This was replaced in winter by a
small sledge. Peter, however, was not fond of his
carriage. “He never,” says Waliszewski,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> “got into a
coach, unless he was called upon to do honour to some
distinguished guest, and then he always made use of
Menshikof’s carriages. These were magnificent. Even
when the favourite went out alone, he drove in a gilded
fan-shaped coach, drawn by six horses, in crimson velvet
trappings, with gold and silver ornaments; his arms
crowned with a prince’s coronet, adorned the panels;
lacqueys and running footmen in rich liveries ran before
it; pages and musicians, dressed in velvet, and covered
with gold embroideries, followed it. Six gentlemen
attended it at each door, and an escort of dragoons
completed the procession.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive the appearance of this fan-shaped
coach, but it must have been almost startlingly
magnificent, just the kind of carriage for the Russian
Buckingham.</p>

<p>In the imperial collection at Petersburg are preserved
one or two Russian carriages of this period. “One,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>”
says Bridges Adams, “is close, made of deal, stained
black, mounted on four wheels, the windows of mica
instead of glass, and the frames of common tin:
the other is open, with a small machine behind of the
shipwright-emperor’s invention&mdash;its purpose to determine
the number of miles traversed on a journey.
In the same collection,” he adds, “is the litter of
Charles XII used at the battle of Pultowa.”</p>

<p>In England glass seems to have been reserved for the
private coaches. For the commoner hackneys a substitute
had been found. “For want of Glasses to our
Coach,” wrote the inimitable Ned Ward in <i>The London
Spy</i>, a book whose outspokenness unfortunately must,
I suppose, have prevented its reprinting in modern days,
“we drew up our Tin Sashes, pink’d like the bottom
of a Cullender, that the Air might pass thro’ the holes,
and defend us from Stifling.”</p>

<p>If, however, contemporary plates are singularly scarce,
and the historians have little to say of the period, there
is a new source of information to be tapped, at any rate
in this country, in the advertisements which just now
began to fill whole pages in the periodicals. Of these
I may quote one or two. One deals specifically with
the question of glass windows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These are to give notice to all Persons that have
occasions for Coach Glasses, or Glasses for Sash Windows,
that they may be furnished with all sorts, at half the
prices they were formerly sold for.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Twelve inches square cost half a crown, thirty-six
inches two pounds ten shillings.</p>

<p>Other advertisements concern the coaches themselves.
In Anne’s day calashes, chaizes, both two-and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>-wheeled,
as well as the larger chariots&mdash;these often
flamboyantly decorated&mdash;were constantly for sale.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A very fine <span class="smcap lowercase">CHAIZE</span>,” we read, “very well Carved,
gilded and painted, and lined with Blue Velvet, and a
very good <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> for it, are to be sold together, or
apart.”</p>

<p>“A curious 4-Wheel <span class="smcap lowercase">SHAZE</span>, Crane Neck’d, little the
worse for wearing, it is to be used with 1 or 2 Horses,
and there is a fine Harness for one Horse, and a
Reputable Sumpture Laopard Covering.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Here then is mention of a four-wheeled chaise with a
perch curved in front after the German fashion. Other
chaises for sale had only two wheels:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At the Greyhound in West Smithfield is to be sold
a Two-Wheeled Chaize, with a pair of Horses well
match’d: It has run over a Bank and a Ditch 5 Foot
High; and likewise through a deep Pit within the
Ring at Hide Park, in the presence of several persons
of Quality; which are very satisfied it cannot be overturn’d
with fair Driving. It is to be Lett for 7s. 6d.
a Day, with some Abatement for a longer Time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One is reminded of Sir Richard Bulkeley’s wonderful
calash. Here was surely a rival. Calashes were now
common, though precisely what the difference was
between them and the two-wheel chaises I am unable
to say. Indeed, there is some confusion also between
the small chariots and the four-wheel chaises, and
the words seem to have become interchangeable.
Both came to resemble the coupé of a later day, being
like a modern coach with the front part removed.
Sometimes the coachman’s box was on a level with the
roof, but often much lower, and sometimes altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
absent, the horses being ridden by a postilion. Probably
the carriage was called a chariot when it possessed a
coachman’s box, such as was used in town, and a chaise
when it was absent.</p>

<p>It was a calash that Squire Morley of Halstead wished
for, but did not obtain, in Prior’s ballad of <i>Down-Hall</i>,
1715.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Then answer’d Squire Morley; Pray get a calash,</div>
<div class="line">That in summer may burn, and in winter may splash;</div>
<div class="line">I love dust and dirt; and ’tis always my pleasure,</div>
<div class="line">To take with me much of the soil that I measure.<br /><br /></div>
<div class="line i04">“But Matthew thought better: for Matthew thought right,</div>
<div class="line">And hired a chariot so trim and so tight,</div>
<div class="line">That extremes both of winter and summer might pass:</div>
<div class="line">For one window was canvas, the other was glass.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Prior evidently liked the chaises of Holland.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“While with labour assiduous due pleasure I mix,</div>
<div class="line">And in one day atone for the business of six,</div>
<div class="line">In a little Dutch chaise on a Saturday night,</div>
<div class="line">On my left hand my Horace, a nymph on my right:</div>
<div class="line">No Memoirs to compose, and no Post-boy to move,</div>
<div class="line">That on Sunday may hinder the softness of love;</div>
<div class="line">For her, neither visits, nor parties at tea,</div>
<div class="line">Nor the long-winded cant of a dull Refugee:</div>
<div class="line">This night and the next shall be hers, shall be mine,</div>
<div class="line">To good or ill-fortune the third we resign:</div>
<div class="line">Thus scorning the world and superior to fate,</div>
<div class="line">I drive on my car in processional state.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another advertisement tells of a gentleman who
brought a one-horse calash to an Inn near Hyde Park
Corner, took away the horse ten days later, but left his
carriage “as a pawn for what was due for the same.”
In a while the inn-keeper was advertising the fact that
unless the owner claimed it within ten days he should
sell the carriage for what it would fetch. A more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
curious advertisement belonging to this period may be
quoted in full:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lost the 26th of February, about 9 a Clock at
Night, between the Angel and Crown Tavern in Threadneedle
Street, and the end of Bucklers Berry, the side
door of a Chariot, Painted Coffee Colour, with a Round
Cypher in the Pannel, Lin’d with White Cloath embos’d
with Red, having a Glass in one Frame, and White
Canvas in another, with Red Strings to both Frames.
Whoever hath taken it up are desir’d to bring it to Mr.
Jacob’s a Coachmaker at the corner of St. Mary Ax near
London Wall, where they shall receive 30s. Reward if
all be brought with it; or if offer’d to be Pawn’d or
Sold, desire it may be stop’d and notice given, or if
already Pawn’d or Sold, their money again.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At this time, if not before, it became customary for
wealthy people to possess coaches used only when they
were in mourning. So we have:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At Mr. Harrison’s, Coach Maker, in the Broadway,
Westminster, is a Mourning Coach and Harness, never
used, with a whole Fore Glass, and Two Glasses and all
other Materials (the Person being deceased); also a
Mourning Chariot, being little used, with all Materials
likewise, and a Leather Body Coach, being very fashionable
with a Coafoay Lining and 4 Glasses, and several
sorts of Shazesses, at very reasonable rates.”</p></blockquote>

<p>What these reasonable rates were does not appear, but
we learn from an agreement made in 1718 between one
Hodges, a job-master, and a private gentleman, the cost
of hiring a complete equipage. Hodges was to maintain
“a coach, chariot, and harness neat and clean, and
in all manner of repair at his own charge, not including
the wheels, for a consideration of five shillings and six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>pence
a day&mdash;this to include a pair of well-matched
horses and a good, sober, honest, creditable coachman.”
If extra horses were required for country work, they
were to be had for half a crown the pair per day. And
if the coachman should break the glass when the coach
was empty, Hodges and not the private gentleman
should be responsible for the damage.</p>

<p>From another advertisement of about the same time
comes the information that the hammercloth of carriages
was constantly being stolen. Ashton<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> gives three such
advertisements.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lost off a Gentleman’s Coach Box a Crimson Coffoy
Hammer Cloth, with 2 yellow Laces about it.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lost off a Gentleman’s Coach Box, a Blue Hammer
Cloth, trimm’d with a Gold colour’d Lace that is almost
turn’d yellow.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lost a Red Shag Hammock Cloth, with white Silk
Lace round it, embroider’d with white and blue, and 3
Bulls Heads and a Squirrel for the Coat of Arms.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The etymology of this hammercloth, which was simply
a covering over the coach-box, seems to have puzzled
people considerably. Most coachbuilders consider that
the box beneath the seat used to contain a hammer and
other tools necessary in case of a breakdown, whence
the name. The anonymous author of the coach-building
articles in the <i>Carriage Builders’ and Harness-Makers’
Art Journal</i> scouts this idea, and suggests that it is
merely a corruption of hamper-cloth&mdash;the box or chest
having originally contained a hamper of provisions.
The last advertisement quoted above gives hammock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>-cloth,
which vaguely suggests suspension of a kind. It
is perhaps not a very important question.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Queen Anne’s Procession to the Cathedral of S. Paul</i><br />
(<i>From Pennant’s “London”</i>)</p></div>

<p>Advertisements also mention a “<i>Curtin Coach for 6
People</i>,” and “a <i>Chasse marée Coach</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> which was some
form of covered waggon; but, unfortunately, I have not
been able to discover any information about them.</p>

<p>The State Coaches of this time were as handsome as
ever. George I, Mrs. Delaney has recorded, rode in a
coach that was “covered with purple cloth; the eight
horses the beautifullest creatures of their kind were
cream colour”&mdash;the custom of using cream-coloured
horses still obtains in the State Coach of Great Britain&mdash;“the
trapping purple silk, and their manes and tails
tied with purple riband.” Luttrell in his Diary for
May 20th, 1707, says of a foreign coach:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Yesterday the Venetian Ambassadors made their
public entry thro’ this citty to Somerset House in great
state and splendour, their Coach of State embroidered
with gold, and the richest that ever was seen in England:
they had two with 8 horses, and eight with 6 horses,
trimm’d very fine with ribbons, 48 footmen in blew
velvet cover’d with gold lace, 24 gentlemen and pages
on horseback, with feathers in their hats.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Venetians apparently prided themselves on a
magnificent display, and four years later Swift, in one
of his letters to Stella, was commenting upon their
ambassador’s coach again&mdash;“the most monstrous, huge,
fine, gilt thing that ever I saw,” he says of it. Every
possible luxury was commandeered for these State
vehicles. One of the Emperors built a coach “studded
with gold” for his bride. Another’s consort rode in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>a carriage “covered with perfumed leather.” The
wedding carriage of the first wife of the Emperor
Leopold had cost 38,000 florins. But the Austrian
State Imperial Coach, built in 1696, was perhaps the
most gorgeous of all. Immense sums too were being
spent on coaches by private individuals. Swift writes
on February 6th, 1712: “Nothing has made so great a
noise as one Kelson’s chariot, that cost nine hundred
and thirty Pounds, the finest was ever seen. The rabble
huzzaed him as much as they did Prince Eugene.”
Fashion decreed six horses. “I must have Six Horses
in my Coach,” says Mrs. Plotwell in the <i>Beau’s Duel</i>,
“four are fit for those that have a Charge of Children,
you and I shall never have any”; and in another of
Mrs. Centlivre’s comedies, Lucinda says to Sir Toby
Doubtful: “You’ll at least keep Six Horses, Sir Toby,
for I wou’d not make a Tour in High Park with less
for the World: for me thinks a pair looks like a
Hackney.” Abroad even more display was made.
“Two coaches,” wrote Lady Mary from Naples in
1740, “two running footmen, four other footmen, a
gentleman usher, and two pages, are as necessary here
as the attendance of a single servant is at London.”</p>

<p>Nor was carriage-driving confined to the gentry.
Every retired tradesman appeared abroad in his coach
and aped the noble, a matter which disturbed Sir
Richard Steele, who in one of the <i>Tatlers</i> drew attention
to the truly lamentable fact that you could not possibly
estimate the social position of the occupant of a coach
by the appearance of his equipage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For the better understanding of things and persons,”
he writes, “in this general confusion, I have given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>directions to all the coachmakers and coachpainters in
town, to bring me in lists of their several customers;
and doubt not, but with comparing the orders of each
man, in the placing of his arms on the door of his
chariot, as well as the words, devices and ciphers to be
fixed upon them, to make a collection which shall let us
into the nature, if not the history, of mankind, more
usefully than the curiosities of any medallist in Europe.
It is high time,” he continues, “that I call in such
coaches as are in their embellishment improper for the
character of their owners. But if I find I am not
obeyed herein, and think I cannot pull down those
equipages already erected, I shall take upon me to
prevent the growth of this evil for the future, by
inquiring into the pretensions of the persons, who shall
hereafter attempt to make public entries with ornaments
and decorations of their own appointment. If a man,
who believed he had the handsomest leg in this kingdom,
should take a fancy to adorn so deserving a limb with a
blue garter, he would be justly punished for offending
against the Most Noble Order; and, I think, the
general prostitution of equipage and retinue is as
destructive to all distinction, as the impertinences of
one man, if permitted, would certainly be to that
illustrious fraternity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The temptation for display must have been great.
Nothing attracted the public attention like a fine coach.
In the north of Scotland, indeed, any carriage caused
the profoundest astonishment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I was entertained,” says a contemporary writer,
“with the Surprise and Amusement of the Common
People when in the year 1725 a Chariot with six
monstrous great Horses arrived here by way of the
Sea Coast. An Elephant publicly exhibited in the
Streets of London could not have excited greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>admiration. One asked what the Chariot was; another,
who had seen the gentlemen alight, told the first with
a Sneer at his Ignorance, it was a great cart to carry
people in, and such like.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And even in Johnson’s day, when there were few
coaches to be found in this part of the country, though
a lighter vehicle called in old account books a <i>cheas</i> was
sometimes used, public astonishment was great. Yet it
was in the north of Scotland that military roads were
constructed in 1726 and 1737&mdash;not particularly good
roads, but very necessary&mdash;and the first of their kind.</p>

<p>Swift in <i>Apollo, or a Problem Solved</i>, satirised the
prevailing luxury. Compared with Apollo, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“No heir upon his first appearance,</div>
<div class="line">With twenty thousand pounds a year rents,</div>
<div class="line">E’er drove, before he sold his land,</div>
<div class="line">So fine a coach along the Strand:</div>
<div class="line">The spokes, we are by Ovid told,</div>
<div class="line">Were silver, and the axle gold:</div>
<div class="line">I own, ’twas but a coach-and-four,</div>
<div class="line">For Jupiter allows no more.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But whether Jupiter allowed it or not, your fashionable
dame had six horses put into her coach, and the more
grooms in attendance upon her, the better for her reputation
as a Person of Quality. There is a good story, by
the way, of Swift and a hackney coach. It is told by
Leigh Hunt in his essay on <i>Coaches</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He was going,” says Hunt, “one dark evening, to dine
with some great man, and was accompanied by some other
clergymen, to whom he gave their clue. They were all in
their canonicals. When they arrive at the house, the coachman
opens the door, and lets down the steps. Down steps
the Dean, very reverend in his black robes; after him
comes another personage, equally black and dignified;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>then another; then a fourth. The coachman, who
recollects taking up no greater number, is about to put
up the steps, when another clergyman descends. After
giving way to this other, he proceeds with great confidence
to toss them up, when lo! another comes.
Well, there cannot, he thinks, be more than six. He is
mistaken. Down comes a seventh, then an eighth;
then a ninth; all with decent intervals; the coach in
the meantime rocking as if it were giving birth to so
many daemons. The coachman can conclude no less.
He cries out ‘The devil! the devil!’ and is preparing
to run away, when they all burst into laughter. They
had gone round as they descended, and got in at the
other door.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be that the private coaches and chariots were
rather more comfortable than the hackneys, but nothing,
it seems, could equal the tortures which were inflicted
upon the unfortunate passengers who were forced to
ride in the public carriages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When our <i>Stratford</i> Tub,” writes Ned Ward, “by
the Assistance of its Carrionly Tits of different colours,
had outrun the Smoothness of the Road, and enter’d
upon <i>London</i>-Stones, with as frightful a Rumbling as an
empty <i>Hay-Cart</i>, our Leathern-Conveniency<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> being
bound in the Braces to its good Behaviour, had no more
Sway than a <i>Funeral Hearse</i>, or a <i>Country-Waggon</i>, that
we were jumbled about like so many <i>Pease</i> in a Childs-Rattle,
running, at every Kennel-Jolt, a great hazard of
a Dislocation: This we endured till we were brought
within White-Chappel Bars, where we Lighted from our
Stubborn Caravan, with our Elbows and Shoulders as
Black and Blew as a <i>Rural Joan</i>, that had been under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>the Pinches of an Angry <i>Fairy</i>. Our weary Limbs
being rather more Tir’d than Refresh’d, by the Thumps
and Tosses of our ill-contriv’d Engine, as unfit to move
upon a Rugged Pavement as a Gouty Sinner is to valt
o’er <i>London Bridge</i>, with his Boots on. For my part,
said I, if this be the Pleasure of Riding in a Coach thro’
<i>London-Streets</i>, may those that like it enjoy it, for it has
loosen’d my Joynts in so short a Passage, that I shall
scarce recover my former Strength this Fortnight; and,
indeed, of the two, I would rather chuse to cry <i>Mouse-Traps</i>
for a Livelihood, than be oblig’d every day to be
drag’d about Town under such uneasiness; and if the
Qualities Coaches are as troublesome as this, I would
not be bound to do their Pennance for their Estates.
You must consider, says my Friend, you have not the
right Knack of Humouring the Coaches Motion; for
there is as much Art in Sitting in a coach finely, as
there is in riding the Great Horse; and many a
younger Brother has got a good Fortune by his Genteel
Stepping in and out, when he pays a Visit to her Ladyship.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In Fleet Street, it seems, things were very bad. “The
Ratling of Coaches,” says Ward, “loud as the <i>Cataracts</i>
of <i>Nile</i> Rob’d me of my Hearing, and put my Head
into as much disorder as the untunable Hollows of a
Rural Mob at a Country <i>Bull-Baiting</i>.” More trouble
followed later in the day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Now, says my Friend, I believe we are not tired
with the Labours of the Day; let us therefore Dedicate
the latter part purely to our Pleasure, take a Coach and
go see <i>May-Fair</i>. Would you have me, said I, undergo
the Punishment of a Coach again, when you know I
was made so great a sufferer by the last, that it made
my Bones rattle in my Skin, and has brought as many
Pains about me, as if troubled with Rheumatism. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>was a Country Coach, says he, and only fit for the
Road; but <i>London</i> Coaches are hung more loose to
prevent your being Jolted by the Roughness of the
Pavement. This Argument of my Friends prevail’d
upon me, to venture my Carcase a second Time to be
Rock’d in a <i>Hackney</i> Cradle. So we took Leave of the
<i>Temple</i>, turn’d up without <i>Temple-Bar</i>, and there took
Coach for the General Rendezvous aforementioned.</p>

<p>“By the help of a great many Slashes and Hey-ups,
and after as many Jolts and Jumbles, we were dragg’d to
the <i>Fair</i>, where our Charioteer had difficulty with his
fare&mdash;the gay ladies refusing to pay, but one eventually
pledging her scarf and taking his number.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is to be remembered that at this time, as in the last
century, the hackney coaches were used much in the
manner of the modern omnibus. You did not necessarily
have one to yourself. The same held good with
regard to the post-chaises. Advertisements were constantly
appearing for a “partner.”</p>

<p>The uneasy motion which so disturbed Ned Ward
was a matter which was receiving the attention of carriage-builders,
but little enough was done. Yet in
England, France and Spain, quite a number of strange
machines (including one which was supposed to go
without horses) were invented, and had their day, and
disappeared into the lumber-room of time. Two in
particular, though in the main unsuccessful, deserve
mention.</p>

<p>One, properly belonging to the seventeenth century,
concerned a new steel spring, patented in 1691 by a
Mr. John Green. It was thus advertised:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“All the nobility and gentry may have the carriages of
their coaches made new or the old ones altered, after this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>invention, at reasonable rates; and hackney and stage
coachmen may have licences from the Patentees, Mr.
<i>John Green</i> and Mr. <i>William Dockwra</i>, his partner, at
the rate of 12<i>d.</i> per week, to drive the roads and streets,
some of which having this week began, and may be
known from the common coaches by the words patent
Coach being over both doors in carved letters. These
coaches are so hung as to render them easier for the
passenger and less labour for the horses, the gentleman’s
coaches turning in narrow streets and lanes in as little or
less room than any French carriage with crane neck, and
not one third of the charge. The manner of the coachman’s
sitting is more convenient, and the motion like
that of a sedan, being free from the tossing and jolting
to which other coaches are liable over rough and broken
roads, pavements or kennels. These great Conveniences
(besides others) are invitation sufficient for all
persons that love their own ease and would save their
horses draught, to use these sort of carriages and no
other, since these carriages need no alteration.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, in addition to the spring, there was some kind
of turning head&mdash;a question which occupied the attention
of designers throughout the next century, but nothing
more of Mr. John Green or of his partner was heard of,
and his patent coaches found few if any purchasers.</p>

<p>The other contrivance was a primitive form of gear
invented by one James Rowe. In 1727 this Rowe
wrote a book&mdash;not, however, published until 1734&mdash;called
<i>All Sorts of Wheel Carriage, Improved</i>. This was a
small tract “wherein is plainly made to appear, that a
much less than the usual Draught of Horses, etc., will be
required, in Waggons, Carts, Coaches, and all other Wheel
Vehicles” by the application of small “friction wheels
and pulleys.” Rowe obtained a patent for his gear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
apparently applied his small wheels to the axle just
within the ordinary wheels, but his own coach was probably
the only one ever to be so fitted. It was felt no
doubt that the whole question was one of roads rather
than of carriages. Improve your roads, and the discomforts
of travelling would disappear.</p>

<p>The British stage-coaches of this time were, according
to Sir Walter Scott,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“constructed principally of a dull black leather, thickly
studded, by way of ornament, with black-headed nails
tracing out the panels; in the upper tier of which were
four oval windows, with heavy red wooden frames, and
green stuff or leathern curtains. Upon the doors, also,
there appeared but little of that gay blazonry which
shines upon the numerous quadrigae of the present
time; but there were displayed in large characters the
names of the places whence the coach started, and
whither it went, stated in quaint and ancient language.
The vehicles themselves varied in shape. Sometimes they
were like a distiller’s vat; sometimes flattened, and hung
equally balanced between the immense front and back
springs; in other instances they resembled a violincello
case, which was past all comparison the most fashionable
form; and they hung in a more genteel posture, namely,
inclining on to the back springs, and giving to those who
sat within the appearance of a stiff Guy Faux, uneasily
seated. The roofs of the coaches, in most cases, rose
into a swelling curve, which was sometimes surrounded
by a high iron guard.... The coachman, and the
guard, who always held his carabine ready bent, or, as we
now say, cocked upon his knee, then sat together; not
as at present, upon a close, compact varnished seat, but
over a very long and narrow boot, which passed under a
large spreading hammer cloth, hanging down on all
sides, and finished with a flowing and most luxurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>fringe. Behind the coach was the immense basket
stretching far and wide beyond the body, to which it was
attached by long iron bars or supports passing beneath
it; though even these seemed scarcely equal to the
enormous weight with which they were frequently
loaded. They were, however, never very great
favourites, although their difference of price caused
them frequently to be well filled, for, as an ancient
Teague observed, ‘they got in so long after the coach,
that they ought to set out a day sooner, to be there at
the same time. Arrah!’ continued he, ‘can’t they give
it the two hind wheels, and let it go first?’ The wheels
of these old carriages were large, massive, ill-formed,
and usually of a red colour; and the three horses that
were affixed to the whole machine&mdash;the foremost of
which was helped onward by carrying a huge long-legged
elf of a postillion, dressed in a cocked hat, with
a large green and gold riding coat&mdash;were all so far parted
from it by the great length of their traces, that it was
with no little difficulty that the poor animals dragged
their unwieldy burthen along the road. It groaned,
and creaked, and lumbered, at every fresh tug which they
gave it, as a ship, rocking or beating up, through a
heavy sea, strains all her timbers with a low-moaning
sound, as she drives over the contending waves.”</p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder, said Scott, that at this time people invariably
made their wills before setting out on a journey
of any length. The dangers were manifold and very real.</p>

<p>In France the stage-coaches, or <i>diligences</i>, were very
similar “with large bodies, having three small windows
on each side and hung by leather braces on long perch
carriages, with high hind wheels and low front wheels,
without any driving box and fitted with large baskets,
back and front for passengers or luggage; they were
drawn by five horses and driven by a postillion on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
off wheeler instead of the near wheeler as in England.”
One, at any rate, of these diligences had springs of a
kind. Another public coach in France at this time was
the <i>gondola</i>, holding ten or twelve passengers inside,
these sitting sideways with one at each end, a second
attempt at a kind of omnibus. Still another public
vehicle popular about this time in Paris was the <i>coucou</i>.
Of this weird machine Ramée says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Figure a box, yellow, green, brown, red, or sky
blue, open in front, having two foul benches which had
formerly been stuffed, on which were placed six unfortunate
voyagers. In the sides it had, right and left, one or
two square openings, to give air during the day or in
summer. While the interior was sufficiently open to
the world, there was built an apron in front, framed in
woodwork and covered with sheet iron. Upon this
apron was thrown a third bench, on which were seated
the driver of the <i>coucou</i> and two passengers who were
termed <i>lapins</i> (rabbits).”</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>coucou</i> was regularly to be seen lumbering painfully
along with its ten or a dozen passengers, its snail’s
pace giving it the ironical name of <i>vigoureux</i>. The
poorer people almost exclusively used the <i>coucou</i>,
although a smart woman with her pet dog, or a gentleman
who had been unable to find a place in the more
aristocratic <i>gondola</i>, were occasionally to be seen in its
interior sandwiched in between two peasants.</p>

<p>In Spain the <i>coucou</i> found an equivalent in the <i>galera</i>,
which was provided with the ubiquitous basket&mdash;a low
waggon it was, with its sides formed of a number of
wooden spokes at a considerable distance from each
other, and having no bottom save a strip of spartum on
which the trunks and packages were heaped. In Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
there were several types of cart, two-or four-wheeled,
which likewise plied for passenger hire. One of these,
called a <i>correo real</i>, seems to have travelled at rather a
greater pace, though with even less comfort to the unfortunate
passengers than the others. A century later
this <i>correo real</i> was described by Théophile Gautier, who
speaks of it as “an antediluvian vehicle, of which the
model could only be found in the fossil remains of
Spain, immense bell-shaped wheels, with very thin
spokes, considerably behind the frame, which had been
painted red somewhere about the time of Isabella the
Catholic; an extravagant body full of all sorts of
crooked windows, and lined in the inside with small
satin cushions, which may at some period have been
rose-coloured, and the whole decorated with a kind of
silk that was once probably of various colours.”</p>

<p>In 1743 the system of travelling post, which so
long before as 1664 had been common in France, was
introduced into England by one John Trull, an artillery
officer, who obtained a patent for letting carriages for
hire across country. These were the <i>post-chaises</i>, of
which the first were two-wheeled with the door in front&mdash;in
this respect being similar to the French <i>chaises de
poste</i>, from which the idea was taken. Trull’s scheme,
however, though successful in itself does not seem to
have brought money to its inventor, who thirty years
later died in the King’s Bench. The door of these
first post-chaises “was hinged at the bottom and fell
forward on to a small dasher like a gentleman’s cabriolet,”
and there was a window on either side. “It was
hung upon two very lofty wheels,” says Thrupp, “and
long shafts for one horse, and the body was rather in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
front of the wheels, so that the weight on the horse’s
back must have been considerable. It was suspended
at first upon leather braces only, but later upon two upright
or whip springs behind, and two elbow springs in
front from the body to the cross-bar, which joined the
shafts and carried the step.” Soon, however, these
post-chaises were built with four wheels, and resembled
the ordinary private chariots of the day, though without
their lavish ornamentation. In less than ten years,
however, a larger body was given to them, so that they
came to resemble the coach rather than the smaller and
slimmer chariots, while the coachman’s box was made
very much higher.</p>

<p>The post-chaise became extraordinarily popular. The
literature of the mid-eighteenth century is full of references
to it. All kinds of adventures happened to people
in post-chaises. They were seen in every part of the
country, they could be hired here, there, and everywhere.
Dr. Johnson was only one amongst thousands
who loved them. “If I had no duties,” he records,
“and no reference to futurity, I would spend my life in
driving briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman.”
“I have tried almost every mode of travelling since I
saw you,” wrote Wilkes to his daughter, “in a coach,
chaise, waggon, boat, <i>treckscuyt</i>, <i>traineau</i>, sledge, etc.
I know none so agreeable as my English post-chaise.”</p>

<p>One thinks naturally of Laurence Sterne. Both in
<i>Tristram Shandy</i> and in the <i>Sentimental Journey</i> he has
much to say of the post-chaises. “Something is always
wrong,” he is grumbling somewhere, “in a French post-chaise,
upon first setting out.... A French postillion
has always to alight before he has got three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
yards out of town.” And then, of course, there is that
never-to-be-forgotten <i>désobligeante</i> which he purchased
from M. Dessein at Calais.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There being no travelling in France and Italy,” he
recounts, “without a chaise&mdash;and nature generally
prompting us to the thing we are fittest for, I walk’d
out into the coach-yard to buy or hire something of
that kind to my purpose: an old <i>Désobligeante</i>, in the
furthest corner of the court, hit my fancy at first sight,
so I instantly got into it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And there it was in that queer little carriage which
would hold but one person, that Sterne wrote his famous
Preface about Travellers, “though it would have been
better,” he observed, when interrupted, “in a <i>Vis-à-Vis</i>.”
The particular <i>désobligeante</i> seems to have proved satisfactory,
but for the species Sterne could not find much
praise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In Monsieur Dessein’s coach-yard,” he says, “I saw
another old tatter’d <i>désobligeante</i>; and notwithstanding
it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy
so much in the coach-yard but an hour before, the
very sight of it stirr’d up a disagreeable sensation within
me now; and I thought ’twas a churlish beast into whose
heart the idea could first enter, to construct such a
machine; nor had I much more charity for the man
who could think of using it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>
<p>It was certainly not a very sociable carriage, but then
neither was the sedan: both were very useful.</p>

<p class="tb">I may conclude this chapter by drawing attention to
the tax upon coaches which was levied at the beginning
of 1747. From the fuss that was made when such a bill
was first introduced&mdash;it was temporarily abandoned&mdash;you
might imagine that one of the most treasured
articles of the Constitution was about to be swept away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is impossible to express,” wrote a country clergyman
to his bishop in a letter which deserves quotation
as affording an insight into the lesser equipages used
in the country at this time, “the various impressions
your lordship’s letter, relating to the tax upon coaches,
made here; as people imagined it a jest, or serious:
As most inclined to the former, it would be too tedious
to trouble you with the witticisms and conundrums it
occasioned. B. said the Church was in danger; C.
observed it would be like the gospel-feast inverted, that
the maimed and lame being the only guests admitted
there, would be the only ones excluded here.... As
we have now no reason to doubt such a tax being really
intended, give me leave to represent to you our thoughts
of it here. My living, your Lordship knows, is under
£70 <i>per Ann.</i>, yet out of this, some years since, I made
a shift to lay out six pounds on an old chariot, which,
with the help of my ploughman and a pair of cart-horses,
has drawn my wife, etc., half a mile to church,
who, for the future, must go in a cart, or stay at home.
Repairs, etc., have cost me, <i>communibus annis</i>, for the
eleven years I have had it, about 7s. so the interest
of my money, at 5 <i>per cent</i>, on the £6 and 7s. in repairs,
is 13s. <i>per Ann.</i>, which with tax on this my pompous
luxury, will be increased to £4 13s. <i>per Ann.</i>, almost
the prime cost of setting up my Equipage. I am afraid
this is not my case singly, but will be found pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>nearly so, of most of the small clergy in England.
Among the laity we have several gentlemen farmers,
who manage, in some degree, with the same frugality,
and who, for the same reasons, are prepared to part
with, or continue them according to the fate of this
bill; insomuch, that I can compute that in sixteen
parishes I have in my eye three times that number of
coaches will be disposed of, for we look on the same
sum, which is but a trifling duty on grand equipages,
to amount to a prohibition on ours, which resembles
them no more than a ragged coat does an embroidered
suit. I shall not dwell on the quantity of glass (not to
mention leather, etc.), this will bring to market, nor
the future consumption of these commodities it will
prevent.... To me I own it looks a little like the son
eating the father.... How many single gentlemen,”
he goes on to ask, after pointing out that it is the
poorer married men who will suffer most, “from 2, 3,
to 800<i>l.</i> a year, and more, have no coaches, yet keep
a stable of hunters (the worst of which would purchase
my equipage) and a pack of hounds, whom this duty
will not affect?”</p></blockquote>

<p>But the bill was passed, and so we must suppose that
our clergyman and his farmer friends were forced to
walk to church.</p>

<p>Some verses printed in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> at
this time may also be quoted as reflecting the general
opinion about the bill.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">“</span><span class="dropcap">I</span>N my journey to <i>London</i>,” wrote an indignant
correspondent to the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,
early in 1747, “I travell’d from <i>Harborough</i> to
<i>Northampton</i>, and well was it that I was in a
light Berlin, and six good horses, or I might have
overlaid in that turnpike road. But for fear of life
and limb, I walk’d several miles on foot, met 20 waggons
tearing their goods to pieces, and the drivers
cursing and swearing for being robb’d on the highway
by a turnpike, screen’d under an Act of Parliament.”
These turnpikes, or toll-gates, had been but lately
established in England for the preservation of the
roads. That they did very much immediate good,
however, may be doubted. A few years afterwards
an English traveller was grumbling at the superiority
of the French roads over our own. “Nothing piques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
me more,” he wrote in an amusingly satirical passage,
“than that a trumpery despotic Government, like
France, should have enchanting roads from the capital
to each remote part.” He seems to have taken trouble
to find out the cause for so lamentable a difference, and
for this purpose consulted “the most solemn looking
waggoner on the road.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This prov’d to be <i>Jack Whipcord</i> of <i>Blandford</i>.
Jack’s answer was ‘That roads had but one object,
namely, waggon-driving. That he requir’d but five
feet wedth in a line [which he resolved never to quit],
and all the rest might go to the d&mdash;&mdash; l. That the
gentry ought to stay at home and be d&mdash;&mdash; and
not run gossiping up and down the country. But,
added <i>Jack</i>, we will soon cure them, for my brethren
since the late act have made a vow to run our wheels
in the coach quarter. We tack on a sixth or seventh
horse at pleasure. What a plague would they send us
to the galleys for this, as papishes do in beyond-sea
countries.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Act to which Jack referred had been passed in
1745. It followed upon the fact that while coaches,
generally speaking, were in process of becoming lighter,
carts and waggons were becoming much heavier. And
so it had been proposed that no waggon should be
drawn by more than four horses, no matter whether
these were “in length, pairs or sideways,” and no cart
should have more than three. Every horse above these
numbers could be forfeited together “with all geers,
bridles, halters, harness and accoutrements.” There
were to be collectors of tolls, and gentlemen’s private
carriages and purely agricultural waggons were to be
exempt. Also certain roads, presumably those but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
lately laid down according to the best ideas of the
time, were to be treated as outside the scope of the
Act. And if the wheels of these heavy waggons and
carts possessed “wheels bound with streaks or tire
of the breadth of eight inches at least when worn and
not set on with rose-headed nails,” they might likewise
be exempt.</p>

<p>This Bill gave rise to a curious wordy warfare, which
was carried on for some years, and may be said to have
interested people in the general questions of wheeled
traffic right on until the time when McAdam’s schemes
altogether altered general opinion. This war, of course,
hardly touched private carriages, but was waged in
so many quarters and with such various weapons
that it deserves some mention in any account of
carriages.</p>

<p>It was immediately “objected by multitudes” that
the Bill of 1745 would “greatly enhance the price
of carriage of goods,” but its apologists argued that
even if it did, better-designed carriages and carts
would be built, so that the roads would improve, and
the price of cartage ultimately go down. “It is
urged,” they said, “that light carts or waggons may
be used, and the horses draw double, as in the rabbet
waggons of Norfolk, which improves the road and
contributes to expedition.”</p>

<p>At an early stage in this war two factions arose.
On the one hand you had coachbuilders and others
filling the newspapers and publishing tracts, some
very serious, some extraordinarily mathematical, others
merely facetious, to prove that the roads could be
preserved only by using very broad wheels&mdash;some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
indeed, advocated rollers, which, as we shall see, were
actually tried&mdash;and on the other hand you had people
filling more columns, and very dull columns some of
them were, to show that a low broad wheel was the
one thing which no really satisfactory vehicle could
possibly possess. These were the apologists for the
lighter waggons with large but slender wheels. Decrease
your weight, said they, and never mind about
the wheels; it is the great weight that ruins the roads.
How can you decrease the weight, asked the broad-wheel
faction, without increasing the cost of carriage?
Increase the cost of carriage for a while, was the reply,
and see what happens to the roads.</p>

<p>For a time, however, the broad-wheel faction held
the advantage, and when further legislation was made
in 1754, it was entirely in their favour.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is enacted that after next Michaelmas, no wheel
carriage of burthen (except it be drawn by oxen only,
or if by horses with less than five, if a four-wheeled
carriage, with less than four) shall travel any turnpike
road, unless the fellies of the wheels shall be nine inches
from side to side under a penalty of £5, or the forfeiture
of one of the horses, with all his accoutrements,
to the sole use of the person who shall seize them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So soon as such proposals had become law, it was
asked with some pertinence: where were these huge
wheels to come from? What of the heavy expenses
that would fall on the farmers? The parrot cry,
“Your wheels will cost you more,” was hinted at, if
not expressed in so modern a way. Arguments were
put forward to show that the correct height for wheels
was anything between two and eight feet, and the correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
breadth from three to eighteen inches. And the disputes
became tinged with personalities. But the net result
seems to have been that most people fought shy of the
very wide wheels, and were content to use less horses.</p>

<p>The war dragged on, and particular inventions to
cope with the difficulty began to appear. A new tire
was widely advertised. An enthusiastic inventor occupied
two or three pages of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
with details of his particular waggon, which had the
front and back wheels of very different sizes, but what
exactly its advantages might be were not very clear to
any one but himself. Then on the 14th of April, 1764,
one Daniel Bourn of Leominster produced a waggon
on small rollers. Though it was unsuccessful, it led
the way to further experiments, and as will be seen from
the contemporary account immediately below, contained
at any rate one novel feature which was subsequently
widely adopted not only in waggons and carts, but also
in four-wheeled carriages of every description.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Bourn’s new machine for travelling the roads
was tried against a common broad-wheeled waggon, but
did not answer, the common waggon going as well with
four horses, as the new one with eight. The weight
carried was five ton besides the carriage. The wheels
of this waggon are 14 inches; the fore wheels go within
the hind wheels, and are so shallow as to turn under
the bed of the waggon. The <i>Leominster</i> stage waggon
has these wheels.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The experiment took place “abreast between the
new road just by Pancras to within a small distance of
Bog-house Bar.” Apparently the only advantage which
the new waggon possessed was its ability to turn in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
narrow road, but although Mr. Bourn not only continued
to build such waggons, but also answered his
opponents in two tracts, we hear little more of him. Such
“rolling-carts,” however, were also made by one James
Sharpe, of Leadenhall Street. Sharpe was a pushful
man. He believed in his system, and apparently made
those in authority see its advantages. His rollers, you
learn, were cylinders of cast iron, two feet in diameter
and sixteen inches broad. An iron spindle was inserted
through the centre of each. Several of Sharpe’s
waggons were on the roads, but although every facility
was given them, they never really took the popular
fancy. And indeed, they must have been uncouth
monsters rattling along the roads something after the
fashion of the steam-roller of ten years ago. Just about
this time, too, the light-cart faction showed that it was
not in the least moribund. It indited learned and
highly technical articles which the newspapers found
space to print with some regularity. A typical reply to
such articles was inserted in the <i>Public Advertiser</i> early
in 1767:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There are people, I may say,” runs this most impolite
retort, “a depraved Number, who write long
letters upon this Subject in an ignorant Manner. Their
Errors confirm Mankind of a sensible Turn what
Measures ought to be taken for the Benefit of the
trading Part of this Nation. The illiterate Scribblers
he [the last correspondent] means to lash are those that
insist upon the Necessity of Horses going at length
instead of being placed abreast. The Power that draft
Horses have in being placed abreast is so well known,
that ’tis amazing any body is absurd enough to advance
a Doctrine to the contrary. Then again, these deluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Idiots propagate, that the Loads drawn by eight Horses,
having the Wheels placed nine Inches within nine, are
destructive to the Roads, and that the Weight had
better be divided into several narrow wheeled Carriages.
Being thus destitute of Judgment upon the Subject,
they do not reflect that the more Horses and Carriages
the more the Expence increases, consequently that the
internal Trade of this Kingdom would advance in
this Article 100 per Cent. One Waggon with eight
Horses in Pairs, drawing eight Ton upon the new Plan,
don’t do near the Mischief that the same Weight would
in two Waggons with narrow Wheels. Besides, four
Horses at length cannot draw four Ton Weight. A
late trifling Writer upon the Subject says, the Appearance
of a broad Wheel Waggon was terrific. I think
he may be pronounced a Cockney without Ceremony&mdash;a
Cit that carries his Wife and Children four Miles out
of Town in a Tim-Whisky, and, being most likely an
aukward Driver, suffers the Squalls of his Horn-making
Spouse to alarm his Dove-like Pusillanimity.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a man, the article goes on to say, would surely
be frightened if he saw a three-master sailing the seas,
and he and his kind had better keep quiet upon a subject
of which they appeared so entirely and pitiably ignorant.</p>

<p>The contest began to embrace wider issues than the
mere wheels of waggons. It took in the whole question
of wheeled carriages. It even went so far as to include
a denunciation of the general policy of the Government,
whose legislation, or lack of it, on this vexed question
was, so the light-cart faction maintained, leading directly
to an increase in the price of provisions. Nothing,
apparently, was right. If waggons were constructed on
principles which were as bad as they could be, so were
the Stage-coaches, which also were using the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
roads, though some of the controversialists seemed to
forget the fact.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We are desired,” runs a paragraph in the newspapers
of this time, “to inform the Masters of Stage-Coaches,
Machines, &amp;c., that their present Method of
hanging their Carriages high with a low Fore-Wheel,
and the body of the Coach hung forwards with the
Stems of the Box leaning likewise forwards, is all
upon a ridiculous wrong Principle,&mdash;the Effect of the
Stupidity of Coachmen and Wheelwrights; that if they
pursue the following Regulations, they will find the
same Advantage that the Nobility and Gentry have
already done by adopting this Plan: Let the fore
Wheels be three Feet, six, eight, or ten Inches high, the
Stems of the Box upright, and admit as little Weight
forward as possible upon the low Wheel; the Body of
the Coach to hang low for the Convenience of Passengers,
as no Benefit arises from its Hanging high to
the Horses, their Advantage laying intirely upon the
Height of the Fore-Wheels.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This in its turn was argued. Then came a proposal
to tax private carriages according to the number of
horses used, and see whether such revenue would not
counterbalance in some way the increase in the prices of
provisions, which, of course, was following on this
eternal wrangle of the waggons. Also there was more
legislation. Some of the new regulations read curiously.
“No tree or bush is to be allowed to grow
or stand within fifteen feet of the center of the highway,
on forfeiture of 10s. by the owner.” Cartways
were to be at least twenty feet wide, and horse
causeways three feet wide. No waggon with more than
four horses might have wheels less than nine inches in
width, and some one on horseback or on foot had to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
in front of it. More criticism filled the newspapers,
and more inventions appeared.</p>

<p>Meetings were held. One advertisement which appeared
in 1767 has an agreeable air of mystery about it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“All persons working Shod-wheel’d Carts, Waggons,
Drays, &amp;c. of all Breadths, are desired to meet at the Sun
Tavern in St. Paul’s Churchyard, on Friday next, at four
o’clock in the Afternoon. Enquire for No. 1.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And more pamphlets appeared, but the roads failed to
improve.</p>

<p>Then in 1770 another Act was passed giving privileges
to the roller-carts which were denied to the ordinary
waggons. “All carriages,” it ordered, “moving upon
rollers the breadth of fifteen inches, are allowed to be
drawn with any number of horses, or other cattle.”
And, as a further inducement, such carts were to be
toll-free for a year. Mr. Sharpe, of Leadenhall Street,
prospered, and wrote to the papers to say so. The
rollers, he maintained, were light and strong, and there
was considerably less friction when they were used.
And he challenged the world to disprove his statement.
Whereupon an anonymous writer belonging to the rival
faction&mdash;possibly Joseph Jacob, a coachbuilder who had
already written against the system&mdash;entered the field,
and ventured to suggest that cast iron was exceedingly
brittle and not very light. Mr. Sharpe speedily replied.
“The principle,” he said, and his point is of interest,
“upon which rolling carriages are adopted is simply
this, That, by the use of them the roads may be made
smooth and hard, and by that means, <i>become part of the
mechanism</i>: for thus the rollers are made to answer all
the purposes of light wheels.” The anonymous writer
appears to have felt the point of this argument, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
forced to retort, quite unworthily, that in any case Mr.
Sharpe’s rollers were not his own ideas. “No,” replied
Sharpe, “they were Mr. Daniel Bourn’s idea&mdash;a very
sensible man and good mechanic, and who was also the
first contriver of nine-inch broad wheels, who so long
as ten or eleven years ago built a waggon on rollers at
Leominster where he then lived, and brought it to the
Society of Arts and Sciences in the Strand, by whom
upon trial it was rejected.” The anonymous writer left
it at that, but the controversy raged fiercely. It became
so highly technical and apparently so interminable that
somebody suggested we should all use flying machines
and leave the wretched roads to look after themselves.</p>

<p>We may leave the war of the wheels here. The
roller-carts were discarded soon afterwards, and M’Adam
and his successors rendered for ever such wars unnecessary.
But it must not be wholly neglected, and
is a tiny chapter by itself in the history of locomotion.</p>

<p class="tb">We come to the curiosities.</p>

<p>To this period belongs the present State Coach of
Great Britain&mdash;that famous “glass-coach” which Londoners
had an opportunity of seeing at King George’s
Coronation. Who built it is not known. Sir William
Chambers, “an amateur,” as Thrupp is careful to point
out, designed it in 1761 for George III. “There is
come forth,” wrote Walpole to Horace Mann, “a new
State Coach which has cost £8000. It is a beautiful
object, though crowded with improprieties. Its supports
are Tritons, not very well adapted to land carriage, and
formed of palm trees, which are as little aquatic as
Tritons are terrestrial. The crowd to see it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
opening of Parliament was greater than at the Coronation,
and much more damage done.”</p>

<p>The ornamentation of the coach, indeed, is a mass of
contradictions, but Sir William Chambers did no more
than follow tradition. For over a century the principal
State Coaches had had Tritons and other queerly inept
figures, and Tritons there were in the new coach for
King George. Gorgeousness was aimed at, and gorgeousness
obtained. There is a detailed contemporary description
of this coach which may be given with an
account of the expenditure, not quite £8000 as Walpole
writes, which it entailed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The carriage is composed of four Tritons, who
support the body by cables fastened to the roots of their
fins: The two placed on the front of the carriage, bear
the driver on their shoulders, and are represented in the
action of sounding shells to announce the approach of
the monarch of the sea; and those on the back part,
carry the imperial fasces, topt with tridents instead of
the ancient axes. The driver’s footboard is a large
scollop shell, supported by a bunch of reeds, and other
marine plants. The pole represents a bundle of lances,
and the wheels are imitated from those of the ancient
triumphal chariots. The body of the coach is composed
of eight palm-trees, which, branching out at the top,
sustain the roof. The four angular trees are loaded
with trophies, allusive to the victories obtained by
<i>Britain</i> during the course of the present glorious war.
On the center of the roof stand three boys, representing
the Genii of <i>England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>, supporting
on their heads the Imperial Crown, and holding in their
hands the scepter, the sword of state, and ensigns of
knighthood. Their bodies are adorned with festoons
of laurel, which fall from thence towards the four
corners of the roof. The intervals between the palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>-trees
which form the body of the coach, are filled in the
upper parts with plates of glass, and below with pannels
adorned with paintings. On the front pannel is represented
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRITANNIA</span> seated on a throne, holding in her
hand, a staff of liberty, attended by <i>Religion</i>, <i>Justice</i>,
<i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Valour</i>, <i>Fortitude</i>, and <i>Victory</i>, presenting her
with a garland of laurels. On the back pannel, <i>Neptune</i>
issuing from his palace, drawn by sea-horses, and attended
by the Winds, the Rivers, Tritons, Naids, &amp;c., bringing
the tribute of the world to the <i>British</i> shore. On one
of the doors are represented <i>Mars</i>, <i>Minerva</i>, and <i>Mercury</i>,
supporting the Imperial Crown of <i>Britain</i>; and on the
other, <i>Industry</i> and <i>Ingenuity</i>, giving a cornucopia to
the Genius of <i>England</i>. The other four pannels represent
the liberal <i>Arts</i> and <i>Sciences</i> protected; <i>History</i> burning
the implements of war. The inside of the coach is lined
with Crimson Velvet richly embroidered with gold. All
the wood work is triple gilt, and all the paintings highly
varnished. The harness is of Crimson Velvet, adorned
with buckles and other embelishments of silver gilt;
and the saddle-cloths are of Blue Velvet, embroidered
and fringed with gold.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Hardly less resplendent was the Lord Mayor’s coach
which had been built at a cost of over a thousand pounds
in 1757, and still performs its duties at stated and regular
intervals. It was in 1711 that a Lord Mayor of
London had ridden for the last time on horseback in
his State procession, this distinction falling to Sir
Gilbert Heathcote. Since that date he has been driven
in his coach. The 1757 coach was not at first the property
of the corporation, but had been built by subscription
amongst the aldermen, to whom it belonged
until 1778, when the corporation bought it. In that
year it had been repaired and repainted&mdash;the panels
possibly by Cipriani, the heraldic devices by Catton,
one of the original members of the Royal Academy and
“coach-painter to George III.” The Lord Mayor’s
coach, like many other State coaches of this date, is full
of allegorical devices of ornamentation, very plutocratic,
very rich, very gorgeous, and incidentally rather
more comfortable to drive in than that in which the
British Sovereign drives to his Coronation.</p>

<p>Coming to lesser matters, we have mention of a carriage
which performed a remarkable feat in 1750.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On Wednesday 29,” runs a notice of this, “at
seven in the morning was decided at <i>Newmarket</i> a remarkable
wager for 1000 guineas, laid by <i>Theobald
Taaff</i>, Esq., against the E. of <i>March</i> and Lord <i>Eglington</i>,
who were to provide a four-wheel carriage with a
man in it to be drawn by four horses 19 miles in an
hour; which was performed in 53 minutes and 27
seconds. The pole was small but lapp’d with fine wire;
the perch had a plate underneath, two cords went on
each side from the back carriage to the fore carriage,
fastened to springs: the harness was of thin leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
covered with silk; the seat, for the man to sit on, was
of leather straps and covered with velvet; the axles of
the wheel were brass, and had tins of oil to drop slowly
for an hour. The breechens for the horses were whale-bone;
the bars were small wood, straightened with
steel-springs, as were most parts of the carriage, but
all so light that a man could carry the whole with the
harness.” Then followed the names of each of the four
horses&mdash;all had riders&mdash;and “lord March’s groom sat
in the carriage. Two or three other carriages had been
made before, but disapproved; and several horses killed
in trials&mdash;to the expence of 6 or 700<i>l.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>Now such a carriage&mdash;there is a print of it by Bodger&mdash;was,
of course, little more than a freak. It was a mere
skeleton, fragile and entirely useless as a mode of conveyance
over the ordinary roads. But the knowledge
of those nineteen miles covered easily within the hour
must have set people thinking. Such a speed was
almost incredible to those accustomed to five or six
miles an hour. The carriage itself was the work of
Mr. J. Wright, a coachmaker in Longacre, already
becoming the home of his brother tradesmen, and it
was doubtless exhibited in London. It showed what
could be done, and must have opened out agreeable
vistas. Twenty miles an hour was something to aim
for, and with the war with France concluded, people
were able and willing to give rather more attention to
the peaceful arts. Amongst other things they showed
a desire for strange vehicles. I have mentioned the
rolling-carts; there were far queerer carriages, as we
shall see, used by the gentry.</p>

<p>The next curiosity I may speak of was seen in the
streets of London during the following year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“An odd machine, like an English waggon, drawn
by 10 horses, after the <i>Danish</i> manner, belonging to
Baron Rosencrantz, the new <i>Danish</i> envoy, came to
his house in <i>Cleveland Row</i>, St. James’s, from <i>Harwich</i>;
a coachman drove it and a postilion rode upon
the 4th horse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It suggests rather a primitive type of coach, possibly
innocent of springs. What the Baron suffered during
his journey through East Anglia must be left to the
imagination.</p>

<p>Eight years later, on August 30th, 1758, another
strange carriage was seen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This day a remarkable carriage set out from <i>Aldersgate-street</i>
for Birmingham, from which it arrived on
<i>Thursday</i> last full of passengers and baggage, without
using coomb, or any oily, unctuous, or other liquid
matter whatever, to the wheels or axles, its construction
being such as to render all such helps useless. The
inventor has caused to be engraved on the boxes of the
wheels, these words, <span class="smcap">Friction Annihilated</span>, and is
very positive that the carriage will continue to go as
long and as easy, if not longer and easier, without
greasing, than any of the ordinary stage-carriages will
do with it: This invention, if really answerable in
practice, is perhaps the must useful improvement in
mechanicks that this century has produced.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One would like to know who was the inventor of this
coach, which, however, did not prosper&mdash;I doubt if it
performed another journey&mdash;for it dropped out of
history as suddenly as it had appeared. It would seem
that the inventor was a Birmingham man. Possibly he
was helped in his scheme by a very extraordinary
character who lived and flourished in that town at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>time&mdash;John Baskerville, successively footman, schoolmaster,
graver, japanner, typefounder, and printer&mdash;a
man whose beautifully printed books have hardly been
excelled to this day. Baskerville had made a fortune
japanning bread-baskets and the like, and now drove
about the country wonderfully dressed in a coach apparently
of his own design&mdash;he was a man who had to do
everything for himself, and being of somewhat eccentric
disposition, never did anything like anybody else&mdash;and
his coach, like his house and his printing and his religious
opinions, was like nothing in the world. He had
a considerable idea of his own importance, and his
coach was a reflection of his character. With its wonderful
arms&mdash;the real Baskerville arms, to which the
printer had no right whatever&mdash;it was standing until
quite recently in an old barn in a field at Manton. It
was thus described fifty years ago:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The body hangs by double straps, from the coachman’s
seat under the carriage, to which they are
fastened, to the frame behind.... It could be either
closed or open, and when open the leather top was
rolled back upon crossed straps hung from the coachman’s
seat, and hooks secured to the front part of the
body. The whole framework of the carriage has been
elaborately carved and gilt, and the panels painted with
what appears to be a brownish green, with flowers and
vases, rock and shell-work, among which were numerous
figures of boys and emblems. In the centre panel
on each side were the arms, on the side panel the
crest....”</p></blockquote>

<p>None of the panels were identical, but all had been
decorated by his workmen. “The pattern-cart of his
trade,” Hutton, the Birmingham historian, calls this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
curiosity, which was once familiar to every village in
the Midlands, and his daughter, Catherine Hutton,
could remember the printer, “in his gold-laced waistcoat,
and his painted chariot, each panel a picture, fresh
from his own manufactory of japanned tea-boards.”</p>

<p>A most extraordinary conveyance appeared in London
in 1771&mdash;this being “Mr. Moore’s new-invented Coal-carriage,”
the wheels of which were no less than fifteen
feet high.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> A great concourse of people followed it
through the streets, and no doubt applauded its ability
to draw two caldrons and two sacks of coal, using only
two horses abreast, “with more ease and expedition
than the common carts do one caldron with three horses
at length.” Unfortunately I have not been able to discover
a print of this monstrous vehicle, which, like so
many of the other mid-century freaks, disappeared
almost at once.</p>

<p class="tb">To this period also belongs that wondrous <i>phaeton</i>,
which in a few years threatened to become so lofty as
to suggest to some ingenious artist the possibility of
applying to it some pantograph arrangement whereby
its seat could be raised or lowered at will. This print,
called The <i>New Fashioned Phaeton&mdash;Sic itur ad Astra</i>,
was published in 1776, a curious mezzotint showing a
lady of fashion stepping out of a first-floor window
into the seat of a phaeton which has been raised to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>required height. The phaetons, indeed, seem to have
been built high since their invention, and the importance
of this feature must not be overlooked, when one remembers
that almost every carriage, both English and
foreign, was hung enormously high in the last years of
the century, nine or ten steps being sometimes necessary
to get inside.</p>

<p>Exactly when or where the phaeton was first made I
cannot determine, but, like the <i>landau</i>, which has generally,
though incorrectly, been considered to have been
first built in 1757, it is mentioned so early as 1747 in
the poem quoted at the end of the last chapter. That
it was already popular with the fashionable people is
shown by Tom Warton’s poem, <i>The Phaeton and the One
Horse Chair</i>, which was first published in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> for December, 1759. This is worth
quoting in its entirety:&mdash;</p>

<p>From this poem it is possible to understand that this
new-fangled carriage was used rather as a toy than anything
else. That it was dangerous clearly appears, and
it was this very danger which must have contributed
not a little to its popularity. It was driven at a very
great rate, and with a recklessness that excited the anger
of the commoner folk&mdash;unless, as was often the case, it
excited their admiration instead. The phaeton was the
most sporting carriage you could have. It lent itself
to the idea of racing, and there was always the chance
that an accident might be fatal&mdash;an allurement in itself.
And so in a very few years there was hardly a fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>able
young gentleman in London who did not possess
one of these carriages and drive about, insolently
staring down from his enormously high seat on to the
heads of the crowds below.</p>

<p>Experiments, too, were being made with them. The
position of the body was gradually brought forward until
it was directly over the front axle. In 1766 “the Hon.
Sir Francis Blake Delavel, Knight of the Bath,” was
experimenting with a “new-invented phaeton the other
side of Westminster Bridge, where he put his horses in
a full gallop, and in a moment, by pulling a string, the
horses galloped off and left him in the carriage, which
stood still.” Sir Francis was apparently working at
some contrivance to be used in case the horses chose to
run away&mdash;a common occurrence, no doubt, and apt to
be far more dangerous to the driver than would be the
case with other carriages, for the body of these early
phaetons was slung high above the undercarriage by
the most delicate supports, which bent and creaked and
were obviously unfitted to bear any great strain. The
body itself must have resembled that of the curious chaises
which were still to be seen at this time in France and
Italy&mdash;just a small chair varnished and sometimes
painted, fixed to four thin and often carved and curled
posts, which as often as not rose merely from the shafts,
there being no springs of any kind. The shafts were
very long, and the common practice seems to have
been to drive two horses tandem, with, no doubt, a
postilion on the leader. The phaeton was probably
slimmer than these equally curious vehicles, and much
higher, and their ability to turn corners with ease may
be deduced from the lines just quoted.</p>

<p>A phaeton built for a lady is shown in a print published
in 1776, called <i>Phaetona; or Modern Female
Taste</i>. Here the carriage has a very small body, hung
very high on large wheels, the undercarriage being
abnormally long in consequence. The two horses
which draw it are very undersized&mdash;another peculiarity
possibly demanded by contemporary fashion.</p>

<p>Two years later the scandalous <i>Town and Country
Magazine</i> published a short and probably true tale
called <i>The Rival Phaetons</i>, which shows to what lengths,
or, rather, what heights the Bucks of the time would go.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Lord M&mdash;&mdash;,” it runs, “emulous of shining in the
most elevated sphere, first drove a phaeton seven feet
from the ground: Sir John L[ade] immediately made
an addition of a supernumerary travelling case to his,
and raised it six inches higher. Lord M&mdash;&mdash; applied
immediately to his coachmaker in Liquor-pond-street
for two travelling cases, with which he speedily drove
about the streets for the entertainment of the public.
Sir John L[ade] was stung to the quick; and Lord
M&mdash;&mdash; ’s round hat was now a mere pigmy to his.
His Lordship, happy at rival inventions, immediately
added two more horses to his triumphal car, and drove
four for expedition, from Grosvenor Square to Gray’s-inn-lane.
‘Now, my Lad,’ said he, ‘I have you;’
but how vain are the boastings of mankind? The
knight appeared the very next day with a phaeton and
six in Holborn. ‘Zounds,’ said his lordship, ‘this is
too much! what shall I do?&mdash;how can I match my
four with two more? No credit at my banker’s&mdash;in
arrears with my horse-dealer&mdash;I am at my wit’s end.
John, I shall not take an airing in Smithfield to-day; I’ll
give my horses some rest&mdash;they were hard worked over
the stones yesterday.’ Here the contest now lies&mdash;its
importance must be obvious to every beholder&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
lordship has not slept these three nights, and it is
imagined he will at length be obliged to take the hint
from Colman’s prologue to the Suicide, and preposterous
as it may appear, add a fifth wheel to his phaeton. Sir
John is greatly elated, and may literally be said to be in
very high spirits upon his temporary triumph.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Writing to Mann in June, 1755, Walpole, after
regretting the absence of social news in England,
mentions the latest Paris fashion. “All the news from
France,” he says, “is that a new madness reigns there,
as strong as that of Pantins was. This is <i>la fureur des
cabriolets, Anglicè</i>, one-horse chairs, a mode introduced
by Mr. [Josiah] Child; they not only universally go in
them, but wear them; that is, everything is to be <i>en
cabriolet</i>; the men paint them on their waistcoats and
have them embroidered for clocks to their stockings;
and the women, who have gone all the winter without
anything on their heads, are now muffled up in great
caps [calash hoods] with round sides, in the form of,
and scarce less than the wheels of chaises.”</p>

<p>“The cabriolet head-dress,” says Wright,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> “was soon
improved into <i>post-chaises</i>, <i>chairs-and-chairmen</i>, and
even <i>broad-waggons</i>.” So we have <i>A Modern Morning</i>,
published in 1757:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Then Caelia to her toilet goes,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>
<p>These cabriolets rivalled the phaetons as fashionable
carriages, and indeed as the <i>new gigs</i> came to resemble
them in every point save the number of the wheels.
There is a print by Colley, dated 1781, showing one of
these new gigs. The small chair, very high, holding
two people, is supported by long curved supports, which
in themselves of course acted as springs of a kind.
Two horses are being driven tandem, with a postilion
driving the leader. Another print, by Bunbury, called
<i>Sir Gregory Gigg</i>, shows a young man driving a pair of
horses abreast. He is seated in a still smaller, and
slightly lower, chair. This was a <i>curricle</i> rather than a
cabriolet, and it was such a carriage which the braggart
sportsman, John Thorpe, describes to Catharine in
<i>Northanger Abbey</i>: “Curricle-hung, you see, seat,
trunk, sword-case, splashing board, lamps, silver-moulding,
all, you see, complete; the ironwork as good as
new, or better. He [the first owner] asked fifty
guineas; I closed with him, threw the money down,
and the carriage was mine.” The shape of these
curricles is well seen in Bunbury’s drawing.</p>

<p>A glance at the newspaper advertisements of the day
will afford an insight into the various carriages in use.
So, for instance, in 1767 we have:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An exceeding good Post chariot, the Box to take off.</p>

<p>A neet genteel Single Horse Chaise, painted green,
and hung upon Steel Springs.</p>

<p>An exceeding fine black gelding that goes well in an
Italian Chair, with a Tail.</p>

<p>A very neat fashionable Chaise.</p>

<p>A very good second-hand Phaeton Chaise, that goes
either with one horse or two, with Shafts, Poles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Harness suitable, Steel Springs, and Iron Axletrees.
Also a good second-hand Landau, which alters occasionally
into a Phaeton, steel springs and Iron Axletrees to
the Carriage.</p></blockquote>

<p>The landau, by the way, was a recent invention
(though made, as we have seen, before 1757) which
may be dismissed with the observation that it was a
coach made to open when required.</p>

<p>And put up for auction together on one occasion
were:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container3">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A green windsor chair,</div>
<div class="line">A good Post-Coach,</div>
<div class="line">A Post Landau,</div>
<div class="line">A very neat Italian Chair,</div>
<div class="line">3 old Chariots,</div>
<div class="line">4 Post-Chaises, and</div>
<div class="line">3 single Chaises.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So run these advertisements, with scraps of information
interspersed and little puffs of the advertiser on
every other line. What the windsor chair was I have
not been able to discover; but it is to be noticed both
that Italian chairs (or chaises) were apparently popular,
and that the English-built carriages were being constructed
on rather a loftier scale. The curious reason for
this will appear in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I may conclude by drawing attention to
two other advertisements of a curious nature.</p>

<p>The first of these deals with a hackney coachman who
had refused to carry a fare. The second, which I do
not think has been reprinted since it originally appeared
in 1767, shows the dangers to which travellers were
still liable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>From the time when the dramatist Congreve had
been appointed a Commissioner for Licensing Hackney
Coaches (1695) there had been frequent legislation with
regard to these hackney coaches. At this time there
were stringent regulations, some of which are still in
force, with regard to the taking up of passengers. It
was the refusal of a coachman to drive a gentleman
who had hailed him that led to the following pitiful
notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Whereas I William Ford, late driver of an hackney
coach, No. 694, did refuse to carry a gentleman, and did
also grosly abuse him; for this I was fined thirty shillings
by the Commissioners. I then most wickedly and
falsely swore an assault against, and had the same gentleman
carried before Sir John Fielding, who discharged
the warrant. For this false imprisonment, I had a
prosecution commenced against me, and though I made
frequent application for pardon, I could not obtain it
until the expence amounted to a sum which has almost
ruined me, and which I have paid. I therefore voluntarily
[?] insert this as a caution to other hackney
coachmen, who well know that it is from the hope of
forgiveness, which they too often meet, that they venture
so daringly to abuse and insult their fare.</p>

<p class="right padr1">“<span class="smcap">William X Ford</span><br />
“His mark.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was this same Sir John Fielding, the blind magistrate,
who inserted, some little time afterwards, the
following warning to travellers and others:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To the Stage Coachmen, Carriers, Book-keepers,</p>

<p><span class="h">To the</span>“Tradesmen in general, and others.</p>

<p>“The remainder of that Gang of unhappy wretches,
who live in Idleness and subsist on Plunder, and who
make it their particular Business, from this Time to the
End of Winter to cut off Trunks from behind Post
Chaises, to steal Goods out of Waggons, from the
Baskets of Stage-Coaches, Boots of Hackney Coaches,
and out of Carts which carry Goods to and from Inns,
&amp;c. (though but few in Number) having already begun
to wait in the Dusk of the Evenings, at the different
Avenues leading to Town, and at several Inns, &amp;c., for
the above Purposes; ’tis hoped that an Attention to
the following Observation, may be the Means of preserving
much Property, which when once lost by these
Means, is difficult to recover, or the Offenders to be
detected.</p>

<p>“1. Those who cannot conveniently fasten their Luggage
before them in Post Chaises, should take care to
secure it behind with a small Chain instead of a Rope
or Strip, and to place the Padlock that fastens it out
of Sight or Reach; and those who have Servants to
attend them, should direct them to keep close to the
Carriage as they come to London, for these Plunderers
extend themselves for fifteen Miles out of Town to the
very Inns themselves in London, and are ready in
an amazing Manner to take Advantage of the least
Neglect.</p>

<p>“2. As it is common for Persons on their Arrival in
Town to take a Hackney Coach when they come on the
Stones, in the Boot of which they generally deposit
their Luggage, they should be cautious never to send
the Coachman from his Box, to make an Enquiry, &amp;c.
for if he be absent a Minute his Fare will be in great
danger of losing his Property, by some of the above
Offenders, who attend at the Inns at the Entrance of
the Town, in order to follow Hackney Coaches to the
Places where they set down or stop, to watch an Opportunity
to plunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>“3. Nothing can secure the Goods in Waggons, or
the Baskets of Stage Coaches, but the Care of the
Drivers, who should have them watched both on and
off the Stones, and the Proprietors of the several Road
Waggons should have a Man at least on Purpose to
guard them five or ten Miles out of Town, a step which
is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">“</span><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the year 1790,” wrote Mr. William Felton in
an account of the carriages of his day, “the art
of Coach-building had been in a gradual state
of improvement for half a century past, and had
now arrived at a very high degree of perfection, with
respect to the beauty, strength, and elegance of our
English carriages.” And the most cursory glance at his
carefully compiled, if technical book, is evidence enough
of the truth of his statement. At this time, indeed, the
old flamboyant ornamentation had all but disappeared
from the carriages, which were in process of taking on
the appearance they largely retain to this day. Most
vehicles, it is true, were still hung far higher than those
of the nineteenth century&mdash;a fact due to the curious,
though mistaken, belief, “that a high and short load
possessed some mysterious property which made it
easier to draw than a long one,” but new principles
were being adopted as the result of careful experiments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Prizes were offered by learned societies, and won. Men
like Dr. Lovell Edgeworth, who had been experimenting
so early as 1768, and had shown that springs&mdash;then but
little understood&mdash;were at least as advantageous to the
horses as to the passengers, were at work. But it was
only in 1804, when Mr. Obadiah Elliott produced his
patent elliptic springs, which rendered unnecessary the
old heavy perch, that a definite period in the art of
coach-building was clearly marked. Thenceforth the
older, cumbrous machines disappeared from the roads
and made way for the lighter and more comfortable
carriages which were to be seen at the time of Queen
Victoria’s accession.</p>

<p>The question of the roads, too, was receiving the
attention of experts. Anstice and Edgeworth published
the results of their investigations, but were both completely
overshadowed by James M’Adam, who about
1810 started those metal roads which have proved so
wonderfully successful. Before his time gravel and the
like had formed the basis of road-material; M’Adam
used granite and other allied substances, and produced
such a surface as had not been seen since the Romans had
constructed their vast highways hundreds of years before.</p>

<p>Methods of travelling, moreover, were altering. The
stage-coaches, useful though they were, disappeared before
Palmer’s mail-coaches, which held their supremacy until
the era of steam revolutionised locomotion. Post-chaises
were still in favour, and less dangerous than of old.
Incidentally, the highwaymen were taking to less
romantic pursuits. And what is true of England was
also in a great measure true of Europe as a whole.
North America, too, at this period was providing herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
with coachbuilders, who produced distinctive vehicles
peculiarly adapted to the conditions of that country.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, a transition period.</p>

<p>We may consider in the first place such types of
carriages as already existed. There is a whole catalogue
of them, and only one of the older carriages is conspicuously
absent. This was the calash&mdash;“now almost
obsolete for any purpose,” comments Leigh Hunt, and
indeed there is hardly a reference to it. But the others
still survived, and one characteristic is immediately
noticeable; the wheels of almost every sort of carriage
at this time were enormously large. Consequently the
carriages were generally very long. Crane-neck perches
were still used, and what was called an upright spring.
A coach of this period, belonging to the museum at
South Kensington, is now exhibited in Edinburgh. It
was built for the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. It has
“a large body,” says Thrupp, describing it, “with deep
panels, flat-sided, longer on the roof than at the elbow,
with windows in the upper quarters; the carriage with
two crane perches (easily seen in the accompanying
photograph), Berlin fashion, whip springs, and very
high wheels. There is no footboard, whilst a hammercloth
for the footman is raised upon scroll ironwork,
very well made.” Napoleon’s state coach, built at the
time of his second marriage, and preserved at Vienna
along with a chariot and barouche, is of a somewhat
similar pattern. His travelling coach, with all its household
contrivances, is now at Madame Tussaud’s exhibition,
and must be familiar to all Londoners. Two
Spanish coaches of the period are also to be seen at
Madrid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><i>George III’s Posting Chariot</i><br />(<i>At South Kensington</i>)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>
<p>The Lord Chancellor’s coach was of course an exceptional
carriage, and Mr. Felton is careful to give
details of such lesser coaches as were being made.
These he catalogues as a plain coach, a neat ornamental
town coach, a landau, a travelling coach, an elegant
crane-neck coach, and a vis-à-vis, which last, he says,
“is seldom used by any other than persons of high
character and fashion.” And, indeed, this particular
carriage is to be seen in numerous plates and caricatures
of the time.</p>

<p>Coming to the chariots and post-chaises, there is a good
example of an English carriage of the kind at South
Kensington. This apparently belonged to George III.
The photograph gives but a poor idea of the great size
of the original. The wheels are taller than an average
man, and the length of the carriage is prodigious. The
single window on either side is small, the panels are
deep, and there is a small platform at the back of the
body to carry luggage. A footboard still remains with
supports for the driver’s seat that has disappeared.</p>

<p class="tb">It was in such a chariot, though even larger than
George III’s, that the unhappy King and Queen of
France attempted to escape from Paris&mdash;that “miserable
new Berline,” as Carlyle calls it, which was the
very last carriage to be used for such a purpose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On Monday night, the Twentieth of June, 1791,”
runs Carlyle’s own wonderful account, “about eleven
o’clock, there is many a hackney-coach and glass-coach
(<i>carrosse de remise</i>), still rumbling, or at rest, on the
streets of Paris.” Into one of these glass-coaches steps
“a hooded Dame with two hooded Children, a thickset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Individual, in round hat and peruke.” The coachman
is Fersen himself.</p>

<p>“Dust shall not stick to the hoofs of Fersen: crack!
crack! the Glass-coach rattles, and every soul breathes
lighter. But is Fersen on the right road? Northeastward,
to the Barrier of Saint Martin and Metz
Highway, thither were we bound; and lo, he drives right
Northward! The royal Individual, in round hat and
peruke, sits astonished; but right or wrong, there is
no remedy. Crack, crack, we go incessant, through
the slumbering City. Seldom, since Paris rose out of
mud, or the Longhaired Kings went in Bullock-carts,
was there such a drive. Mortals on each hand of you,
close by, stretched out horizontal, dormant; and we
alive and quaking! Crack, crack, through the Rue
de la Chaussée d’Antin,&mdash;these windows, all silent, of
Number 42, were Mirabeau’s. Towards the Barrier not
of Saint-Martin, but of Clichy on the utmost North!
Patience, ye royal Individuals; Fersen understands
what he is about. Passing up the Rue de Clichy, he
alights for one moment at Madame Sullivan’s: ‘Did
Count Fersen’s Coachman get the Baroness de Korff’s
new Berline?’&mdash;‘Gone with it an hour-and-half ago’
grumbles responsive but drowsy porter. ‘<i>C’est bien.</i>’
Yes, it is well;&mdash;though had but such hour-and-half
been lost, it were still better. Forth therefore, O
Fersen, fast, by the Barrier de Clichy; then Eastward
along the Outer Boulevard, what horses and whipcord
can do!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><i>The Lord Chancellor of Ireland’s Coach</i><br />(<i>Now in Edinburgh</i>)</p></div>

<p>“Thus Fersen drives, through the ambrosial night.
Sleeping Paris is now all on the right-hand of him;
silent except for some snoring hum: and now he is
Eastward as far as the Barrier de Saint-Martin; looking
earnestly for Baroness de Korff’s Berline. This
Heaven’s Berline he at length does descry, drawn up
with its six Horses, his own German Coachman waiting
on the box.... The august Glass-Coach fare, six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>Insides, hastily packs itself into the new Berline; two
Bodyguard Couriers behind. The Glass-coach itself is
turned adrift, its head towards the City; to wander
whither it lists,&mdash;and be found next morning in a
ditch. But Fersen is on the new box, with its brave
new hammer-cloths; flourishing his whip; he bolts
forward towards Bondy. There a third and final
Bodyguard Courier of ours ought surely to be, with
post-horses already ordered. There likewise ought that
purchased Chaise, with the two waiting-maids and their
band-boxes, to be; whom also her Majesty could not
travel without....</p>

<p>“Once more by Heaven’s blessing, it is all well.
Here is the sleeping Hamlet of Bondy; Chaise with
Waiting-women; horse all ready, and postilions with
their churn-boots, impatient in the dewy dawn. Brief
harnessing done, the postilions with their churn-boots
vault into the saddles; brandish circularly their little
noisy whips....</p>

<p>“But scouts, all this while, and aides-de-camp, have
flown forth faster than the leathern Diligences....”</p></blockquote>

<p>The grand new Berline has been seen in the Wood
of Bondy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Miserable new Berline!” apostrophises Carlyle.
“Why could not Royalty go in some old Berline
similar to that of other men? Flying for life, one
does not stickle about his vehicle. Monsieur, in a
commonplace travelling-carriage, is off Northwards;
Madame, his Princess, in another, with variation of
route; they cross one another while changing horses,
without look of recognition; and reach Flanders, no
man questioning them....</p>

<p>“All runs along, unmolested, speedy, except only the
new Berline. Huge leathern vehicle:&mdash;huge Argosy,
let us say, or Acapulco-ship; with its heavy stern-boat
of Chaise-and-pair; with its three yellow Pilot-boats of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
mounted Bodyguard Couriers, rocking aimless round it
and ahead of it, to bewilder, not to guide! It lumbers
along lurchingly with stress, at a snail’s pace; noted of
all the world.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It has indeed been seen, and soldiers rush after it,
and the huge Berline is brought back to Paris in
what was surely the most terrible procession ever
witnessed....</p>

<p class="tb">The Korff Berline was probably not built so high as
some of the English posting chariots of the time.
The perch of these was often more than four feet
from the ground. According to Felton you could buy
a plain post-chaise for £93, or a neat town chariot for
£91. Or you might have a landaulet, a demi-landau,
or a sulky, which at this time was “a light carriage
built exactly in the form of a post-chaise, chariot, or
demi-landau,” and like the vis-à-vis was “contracted on
the seat, so that only one person can sit thereon, and is
called a sulky from the proprietor’s desire of riding
alone.” The landaulet was to the landau as the chariot
was to the coach. It was simply a chariot made to
open. The hood was of “greasy harness leather, disagreeable
to the touch or smell, and continually needing
oil and blacking” rubbed into it to keep it supple and
black.</p>

<p>Then there was the phaeton, which had lost none of
its popularity, and was built as lofty as ever.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The handsomest mixture of danger with dignity,”
wrote Leigh Hunt, “in the shape of a carriage, was the
tall phaeton with its yellow wings. We remember
looking up to it with respect in our childhood, partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
for its loftiness, partly for its name, and partly for the
show it makes in the prints to novels of the period.
The most gallant figure which modern driving ever cut
was in the person of a late Duke of Hamilton; of
whom we have read or heard somewhere, that he used
to dash round the streets of Rome, with his horses
panting, and his hounds barking about his phaeton, to
the equal fright and admiration of the Masters of the
World, who were accustomed to witness nothing higher
than a lumbering old coach, or a cardinal on a mule.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But far more conspicuous a figure than this Duke of
Hamilton was Colonel (Tommy) Onslow, afterwards
Lord Cranley, of whom there is a caricature by Gillray,
with the following once famous lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“What can little T. O. do?</div>
<div class="line">Why drive a phaeton and two.</div>
<div class="line">Can little T. O. do no more?</div>
<div class="line">Yes, drive a phaeton and four!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Colonel, however, was surpassed, as we have
seen, by Sir John Lade, who drove six greys. George
IV, when Prince of Wales, was satisfied with a pair, but
his horses were “caparisoned with blue harness stitched
with red,” their manes “being plaited with scarlet
ribbons, while they wore plumes of feathers on their
heads.”</p>

<p>The structure of these phaetons differed. Gillray’s
picture shows the body hung midway between the two
axles, though he may not have troubled to be exact in
this respect. The commonest form was the <i>perch-high
phaeton</i>, in which the body was hung directly over the
front axle, the hind wheels being much larger than those
in front, and the bottom of the body being five feet
from the ground. Others were less lofty. In the <i>one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>-horse
phaeton</i> the body was hung over the back axle with
“grasshopper” springs, and “was joined to the forecarriage,
which was without springs, by wooden stays”&mdash;a
very different carriage. This in time led to the
<i>pony phaeton</i> used by George IV in 1824. Here all idea
of great height had been abandoned so as to allow His
Majesty to enter his carriage without the fatigue of
climbing several steps. Queen Victoria’s pony phaeton
was a similar vehicle, and indeed it was from such a
carriage that the <i>victoria</i> was evolved at a rather later
date.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“What connexion there could be,” wrote Bridges
Adams some forty years later in a passage not altogether
devoid of epithets, “between this vehicle and the fabled
car of the Sun-God, to obtain for it such a title, it is
difficult to conceive.... The vehicle looked like a
mechanical illustration of the play of <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i>. It was a contrivance to make an enormously
high and dangerous seat for two persons, inconvenient
to drive from, and at the same time to consume as much
material and mix as many unsightly and inharmonious
lines as possible. The framework of the carriage was
constructed with two iron perches, the outline of which
was hideously ugly; but the camel-like hump had at
least the mechanical advantage of permitting a higher
fore wheel than could otherwise be used. The shape of
the body was as though the rudest possible form capable
of affording a seat had been put together. An ungraceful
form of upright pillar or standard was first
selected, into which was framed a horizontal ugly curve
for a seat, connected at the top by an ungainly-looking
elbow, and a formal serpentine curve behind, from
which was projected like an excrescence an ugly leathern
box called a sword-case. The front of the upright pillar
was continued into a most formal curve, and from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
point rose an ungraceful bracket, to support a footboard,
on the extreme edge of which was coiled an ugly
piece of leather called an apron. The construction of the
body was such that it could not possibly hold together
by the strength of its own framing; and to remedy
this, a curved iron stay was introduced in the worst
possible taste.... The fore springs rather resembled
the flourishing strokes made by a schoolmaster,
when heading a copy-book or Christmas piece,
than any legitimate mechanical contrivance; and the
motion must have been detestable, rendering the
act of driving difficult, and lessening the power of
the drivers over their horses. The servant’s seat behind”&mdash;not
always present&mdash;“placed on curved blocks
without any springs, completed this extraordinary-looking
vehicle. To sit on such a seat, when the
horses were going at much speed, would require as
much skill as is evinced by a rope-dancer at the
theatre.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Which shows that in 1837, at any rate, people’s ideas
had undergone a considerable change with regard to a
really fashionable equipage.</p>

<p>The only other four-wheeled vehicle I need mention
here was the <i>sociable</i> which, according to Felton, was
“merely a phaeton with a double or treble body.” It
was made with or without doors, and with or without a
driving seat. A good example of this carriage is shown
in Gillray’s print <i>The Middlesex Election of 1804</i>.</p>

<p>Coming to the two-wheeled vehicles, the chief of these
were the <i>curricle</i>, the <i>gig</i> or <i>chaise</i>, and the <i>whiskey</i>. As
a general rule it may be taken that when a gig had two
horses it was called a curricle, and when there was only
one, a chaise. In the Prince Regent’s time the curricle
was “the most stylish of all conveyances.” In shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
nearly all these gigs were identical, though one reads
that the notorious “Romeo” Coates drove in one
whose body was shaped like a shell.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> They were of
various heights, a particularly lofty one being known in
Ireland as the <i>suicide gig</i>. The <i>caned whiskey</i> was a gig
whose body, “fixed upon the shafts&mdash;which again were
connected with the long horizontal springs by scroll
irons,” had a movable hood. The <i>Rib Chair</i> was similar
to the whiskey, but without springs. It is really only
possible to differentiate properly between these light
carriages and the other hybrids, so soon to appear, by
means of prints and photographs. To the non-technical
mind they are almost identical with each other.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The prettiest of these vehicles,” Leigh Hunt writes,
after confessing that he has no ambition to drive
tandem, as was so often done, or to run into danger
with a phaeton, “is the curricle, which is also the safest.
There is something worth looking at in a pair of horses,
with that sparkling pole of steel laid across them. It is
like a bar of music, comprising their harmonious course.
But to us, even gigs are but a sort of unsuccessful
gentility. The driver, to all intents and purposes, had
better be on the horse.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I need say very little of the public carriages. There
is, however, one point in connection with the later stage-coaches
which bears upon the question that was only
solved by Obadiah Elliott in 1804. On September 20,
1770, according to the <i>Annual Register</i>, there was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>accident to one of them which was growing increasingly
common.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It were greatly to be wished,” runs this account, “the
stage coaches were put under some regulations as to the
number of persons and quantity of baggage. Thirty-four
persons were in and about the Hertford Coach this day
when it broke down by one of the braces giving way.”</p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder it broke down! It is interesting to note,
however, that even the more humane stage-coachmen, so
far from objecting, as you might imagine they would
have done, to such overcrowding, actively encouraged
it and for a very odd reason. At this time springs of a
kind were being applied to the coaches, which consequently
travelled with greater ease than before, but
the coaches themselves happened also to be built very
high, like all other vehicles, and nothing could convince
the silly coachmen that the easy running was not due to
a heavy load being applied to the top of a high carriage.
It became necessary, therefore, to pass legislation, which
was accordingly done in 1785 and again in 1790, restricting
the number of passengers allowed.</p>

<p>At this time, too, Mr. John Palmer’s first diligence,
or mail-coach, had appeared as a quick and cheap method
of carrying letters, and these mail-coaches very rapidly
took the fancy of passengers. Palmer, however,
was a man with great powers of organisation, and
before the new century had dawned, had his coaches
running upon every high road in the country.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The mail coaches,” wrote a French nobleman after
visiting this country at the beginning of the new century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
“afford means of travelling with great celerity into all
parts of England. They are Berlins, firm and light,
holding four persons; they carry only letters, and do not
take charge of any luggage. They are drawn by four
horses, and driven by one coachman; they travel never
less than seven to eight miles an hour.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One or two particular inventions may also be noted.
This same nobleman, continuing his account, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Stage Coaches are very numerous, they are kept in
every City, and even in small towns; all these carriages
have small wheels, and hold six persons, without reckoning
the outside passengers. About twenty years ago a
carriage was invented in the form of a gondola; it is
long, and will hold sixteen persons sitting face to face;
the door is behind, and this plan ought to be generally
adopted, as the only means of escaping a great danger
when the horses run away. What adds to the singularity
of these carriages is, that they have eight wheels; thus
dividing equally the weight, they are less liable to be
overturned, or cut up the roads; they are, besides, very
low and easy.</p>

<p>“When these long coaches first appeared at Southampton,
a City much frequented in summer by rich inhabitants
of London, who go there to enjoy sea bathing,
they had (as every new thing has) a great run, so that it
was nearly impossible to get a place in them.</p>

<p>“One of the principal Innkeepers, jealous of this
success, set up another, and, to obtain the preference, he
reduced the fare to half-price, at that time a guinea. In
order to defeat this manœuvre, the first proprietor made
a still greater reduction, so that, at last, the receipts did
not cover the expenses. But the two rivals did not stop
here; for one of them announced that he would take
nothing of gentlemen who might honour him by choosing
his Coach, but he would beg them to accept a bottle
of Port before their departure.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But not even such a temptation seems to have made
these long coaches a success.</p>

<p>The other innovation, though properly belonging to
a slightly later date, was the patent coach invented by
the Reverend William Milton. He explained his
coach in a letter to Sir John Sinclair.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Permit me, Sir, to explain, in a few words, the
nature of my invention.&mdash;In a stage-coach, an overturn
is rendered much less likely to happen, by placing as
much as possible of the heavy luggage of each journey,
in a luggage-box below the body of the carriage; the
body not being higher than usual. This brings down
the centre of gravity of the total coach and load (a point
which at present, at every inequality of the road and
change of quarter, vacillates most dangerously), it brings
it down to a place of great comparative safety.</p>

<p>“To prevent the fatal and disastrous consequences of
breaking down, there are placed, at the sides or corners
of this luggage-box, small strong idle wheels, with their
periphery below its floor; ready, in case of a wheel
coming off or breaking, or an axle-tree failing, to catch
the falling carriage, and instantly to continue its previous
velocity; thereby preventing that sudden stop to rapid
motion, which at present constantly attends the breaking
down, and which has so frequently proved fatal to the
coachman and outside passengers.&mdash;The bottom of this
luggage-box is meant to be about twelve or thirteen
inches from the ground, and the idle wheels seven, six,
or five. If at a less distance still, no inconvenience will
result; for when either of them takes over an obstacle
in the road, it instantly, and during the need, discharges
its respective active wheel from the ground, and works
in its stead.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>
<p>Several coaches were built to Mr. Milton’s specifications,
but like so many other patent coaches they were
speedily forgotten.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add here that about 1800
“outside passengers were first enabled to ride on the
roofs of coaches without incurring the imminent hazard
of being thrown off whenever their vigilance and their
anxious grip relaxed.” For it was then, says Mr. Harper,
“that fore and hind boots, framed to the body of
the coach, became general, thus affording foothold to
the outsides. Mail coaches were not the cause of this
change, for they originally carried no passengers on the
roof. We cannot fix the exact date of this improvement,”
he adds, “and may suppose that in common with
every other innovation, it was gradual, and only introduced
when new coaches became necessary on the various
routes. The immediate result was to democratise coach-travelling.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, it became a common practice
amongst the smart youths of the day to drive the stage-coaches
themselves. So we read in a paper of this time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The education of our youth of fashion is <i>improving</i>
daily: several of them now drive Stage Coaches to
town, and open the door of the Carriage for passengers,
while the coachman remains on the box. They <i>farm</i>
the perquisites from the Coachman on the road, and
generally pocket something into the bargain.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Which was, according to the writer, “a fit subject for
ridicule on any stage.”</p>

<p>The post-chaises were as ubiquitous as ever. The
French nobleman, from whose book I have already
quoted, entered one so soon as he landed at Dover.</p>

<p class="caption">“<i>French Travelling, or the First Stage from Dover</i>”<br />(<i>From a Drawing by Rowlandson, 1785</i>)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Post,” he records, “is not, as on the Continent,
an establishment dependent upon the Government;
individuals undertake this business; most of the
inns keep Post Chaises; they are good Carriages with
four wheels, shut close, the same kind as we call in
France <i>diligences de ville</i>. They hold three persons in
the back with ease are narrow, extremely light; well
hung, and appear the more easy, because the roads are
not paved with stone. The postilions wear a jacket
with sleeves, tight boots, and, altogether, their dress is
light, and extremely neat; and they are not only civil,
but even respectful. On your arrival at the Inn, you
are shown into a good room, where a fire is kept in
winter, and tea is ready every hour of the day. In five
minutes at most, another Chaise is ready for your departure.
If we compare these customs with those of
Germany, or particularly in the North, where you must
often wait whole hours to change horses, in a dirty
room, heated by an iron stove, the smell of which is
suffocating; or even those of France, where the most
part of the post-houses, not being Inns, have no accommodation
for travellers, it is evident that the advantage
is not in favour of the Continent.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, England at this time was superior to most
European countries so far as her posting-carriages and
roads were concerned. Leigh Hunt, in expressing his
delight of them, was only following in the wake of
Johnson and the others who had always enjoyed their
cross-country rides.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A post-chaise,” he says, “involves the idea of
travelling which, in company of those we love, is home
in motion. The smooth running along the road, the
fresh air, the variety of scene, the leafy roads, the bursting
prospects, the clatter through a town, the gaping
gaze of a village, the hearty appetite, the leisure (your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
chaise waiting only upon your own movements), even
the little contradictions to home-comfort, and the expedients
upon which they set us, all put the animal
spirits at work, and throw a novelty over the road of
life. If anything could grind us young again, it would
be the wheels of a post-chaise. The only monotonous
sight is the perpetual up-and-down movement of the
postilion, who, we wish exceedingly, could take a chair.
His occasional retreat to the bar which occupies the
place of a box, and his affecting to sit upon it, only
remind us of its exquisite want of accommodation. But
some have given the bar, lately, a surreptitious squeeze
in the middle, and flattened it a little into something
obliquely resembling an inconvenient seat.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Prints of these post-chaises are common. Rowlandson,
in particular, loved to draw them. Gillray, too,
shows the post-chaise in Scotland and Ireland, where
apparently things were not quite so easy as in England.
The Scottish post-chaise is shown breaking to pieces,
and the Irish chaise is little better than a wreck, with
the body held together by a piece of rope, with hardly
a spoke left to the wheels, and a roof put roughly
together of thatched straw. The unfortunate lady inside
has put one foot through the panelling and another
through the floor, which reminds one that it was of an
Irish post-chaise that the famous story of the poor
man who had to run with the carriage because the
bottom had fallen out was originally told.</p>

<p class="tb">It remains to consider a few particular eighteenth-century
carriages of other countries.</p>

<p>Mr. Stratton thinks that the Indians of North
America had rude litters at an early date. The Incas
of Peru certainly possessed magnificently decorated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>sedans or palanquins, in which they progressed through
their kingdom. It was not, however, until the seventeenth
century that wheeled carriages appeared in
America. Sir Thomas Browne quotes from an English
traveller’s book, which states that by the middle of this
century there were at least twenty thousand coaches in
Mexico, and possibly this was true. But into North
America carriages filtered but slowly. There had been
coaches in Boston so early as 1669, and in Connecticut
in 1685. William Penn, writing to Logan in 1700,
bids his servants have the coach ready. The calash
was also known at that time, but being “clumsy” was
less popular than the French cabriolet or gig, which had
been brought over by the Huguenots, and rapidly transformed
into the well-known <i>one-horse shay</i>, which in its
turn was supplanted by the more comfortable and
certainly more distinctive <i>buggy</i>.</p>

<p>Bennet, travelling in America in 1740, saw many
carriages in Boston.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There are several families,” he records, “in Boston
that keep a coach and a pair of horses, and some few
drive with four horses; but for chaises and saddle-horses,
considering the bulk of the place, they outdo
London. They have some nimble, lively horses for the
coach, but not any of that beautiful black breed so common
in London.... The country carts and wagons are
generally drawn by oxen, from two to six, according to
the distance, or the burden they are laden with.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A Boston advertisement of 1743 mentions “a very
handsome chariot, fit for town or country, lined with
red coffy, handsomely carved and painted, with a whole
front glass, the seat-cloth embroidered with silver, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
a silk fringe round the seat.” This was offered for sale
by John Lucas, a local coachbuilder, and had most
probably been built by him.</p>

<p>At this time several stage-coaches were running, and
the <i>shay</i> was being used by even the poorer folk. A
Philadelphian advertisement of 1746 speaks of “two
very handsome chairs, with very good geers,” and at
this time, too, the Italian chairs and curricles were also
popular. They were generally driven tandem.</p>

<p>Even more distinctive than the shay, however, was
the <i>coachee</i>, which is described by Isaac Weld in his
travels (1795):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The body of it is rather longer than a coach, but of
the same shape. In the front it is left quite open down
to the bottom, and the driver sits on a bench under the
roof of the carriage. There are two seats in it for
passengers, who sit in it with their faces to the horses.
The roof is supported by small props, which are placed
at the corners. On each side of the door, above the
panels, it is quite open; and, to guard against bad
weather, there are curtains which let down from the
roof and fasten to buttons on the outside. The light
wagons are in the same construction,” he adds, “and are
calculated to hold from four to twelve people. The
wagon has no doors, but the passengers scramble in the
best way they can over the seat of the driver. The
wagons are used universally for stage-coaches.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The American stage-waggon is also described by
another Englishman, Thomas Twining, who visited the
country in 1795.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The vehicle,” says he, “was a long car with four
benches. Three of these in the interior held nine
passengers. A tenth passenger was seated by the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
of the driver on the front bench. A light roof was
supported by eight slender pillars, four on each side.
Three large leather curtains suspended to the roof, one
at each side and the third behind, were rolled up or
lowered at the pleasure of the passengers. There was
no place nor space for luggage, each person being expected
to stow his things as he could under his seat or
legs. The entrance was in front over the driver’s bench.
Of course, the three passengers on the back seat were
obliged to crawl across all the other benches to get to
their places. There were no backs to the benches to
support and relieve us during a rough and fatiguing
journey over a newly and ill-made road.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The body of these public carriages was high, and the
back wheels were larger than those in front. A somewhat
similar conveyance is still used to-day in some of
the northern districts of Australia.</p>

<p>The commonest vehicle in Russia at this time seems
to have been the <i>taranta</i>, which is described as “a
travelling carriage whose body resembles a flat-bottomed
punt.” The natives apparently considered that it was a
very comfortable carriage, and it certainly could hold a
great quantity of luggage and wraps, but the foreigners
using it did not always express a similar opinion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We travelled certainly with speed,” says Madame
Pfeiffer of the <i>taranta</i>, in her <i>Journey round the World</i>,
“but any one who had not a body of iron, or a well-cushioned
spring carriage, would not find this very
agreeable, and would certainly prefer to travel slower
upon these uneven, bad roads. The post-carriage, for
which ten kopecs a station is paid, is nothing more than
a very short wooden open car, with four wheels. Instead
of a seat some hay is laid in it, and there is just
room enough for a small chest, upon which the driver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
sits. These cars naturally jolt very much. There is
nothing to take hold of, and it requires some care to
avoid being thrown out. The draught consists of three
horses abreast; over the centre one a wooden arch is
fixed, on which hang two or three bells, which continually
made a most disagreeable noise. In addition to
this, imagine the rattling of the carriage, and the shouting
of the driver, who is always in great activity urging
on the poor animals, and it may be easily understood
that, as is often the case, the carriage arrives at the
station without the travellers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Even less “genteel” than the <i>taranta</i> was the <i>kibitka</i>,
“a common posting-waggon,” according to Stratton,
“consisting of a huge frame of unhewn sticks, fastened
firmly upon two axles, the fore part of it having underneath
a solid block of hard wood, on which it rests,
elevating it so as to allow the wheels to play.”</p>

<p>Other Russian carriages were the <i>teleka</i>, the <i>telashka</i>,
and the better-known <i>droitzschka</i>, or, as it was known in
England, <i>drosky</i>&mdash;an improvement originally of the
sledge by the mere addition of springs and wheels. In
Norway the <i>carriole</i> was very similar to the original
French gig, and like the <i>char-à-cote</i> of Switzerland, was
long and narrow and peculiarly adapted for mountainous
countries. But in nearly all the colder regions, wheel
carriages were scarcely used at all, the snow making
some kind of sledge far more convenient. Captain
King, in his <i>Journey across Asia</i>, gives a detailed description
of the sledges then in use (1784) in Kamtschatka.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The body of the sledge,” he says, “is about four
feet and a half long and a foot wide, made in the form
of a crescent, of light, tough wood, strongly bound
together with wicker-work; which in those belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the better sort of people is elegantly stained of a red
and blue colour, and the seat covered with bear-skins,
or other furs. It is supported by four legs, about two
feet high, which rest on two long flat pieces of wood,
extending a foot at each end beyond the body of the
sledge. These are turned up before, in the manner of
a skate, and shod with the bone of some sea animal.
The fore part of the carriage is ornamented with thongs
of leather and tassels of coloured cloth; and from the
cross-bar, to which the harness is joined, are hung links
of iron, or small bells, the jingling of which they conceive
to be encouraging to the dogs. They are seldom
used to carry more than one person at a time, who sits
aside [? astride], resting his feet on the lower part of the
sledge, and carrying his provisions and other necessaries,
wrapped up in a bundle, behind him. The dogs are
usually five in number, yoked two and two, with a
leader. The reins not being fastened to the head of the
dogs, but to the collar, have little power over them, and
are therefore generally hung upon the sledge, whilst
the driver depends entirely on their obedience to his
voice for the direction of them.... The driver is also
provided with a crooked stick, which answers the purpose
both of whip and reins; as by striking it into the
snow, he is enabled to moderate the speed of the dogs,
or even to stop them entirely.... Our party consisted
in all of ten sledges. That in which Captain Gore was
carried, was made of two lashed together, and abundantly
provided with furs and bear-skins; it had ten dogs,
yoked four abreast, as had also some of those that were
heavy laden with baggage.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In Europe and North America these sledges were
also used, and could be highly ornamented. Two of
this kind, narrow and low, may be seen at South Kensington.
They are mentioned by several travellers.
Edward Wright, visiting Amsterdam in 1719, had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
“several coach-bodies drawn upon sledges,” and explained
that the inhabitants did not use wheels “to avoid
shaking the foundations of the houses.” Holcroft, too,
at the end of the century, journeyed from Hamburg to
Paris by way of Holland, and did not hide his surprise
at the appearance of these sledges.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“And pray, sir, what are you?” he asks in the Shandean
manner. “We never saw so staring or so strange
an animal before.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a tropical bird, on a mast.”</p>

<p>“Can it be? A coach without wheels? Yes: dragged
on a sledge by a single horse, and a lady in it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Holcroft also noticed in Amsterdam what he called “a
travelling haberdasher’s shop with wheels, rolled through
the streets by its master.” This appears to have been
some sort of light travelling booth. In Paris itself,
he records, “there is scarcely a street which is not so
narrow as to be extremely dangerous to foot passengers.
They are rendered more so at some times by the extreme
carelessness, and at others by the brutal insolence,
of coachmen. There is no foot pavement; and the
only guard against carriages is formed by large stones
placed at certain distances, but close to the wall.” In
Germany, too, he found little to please him, and warns
Englishmen against bringing English-built carriages into
that country, for of a surety they will be “broken up.”
England, indeed, about this time, seems to have been by
far the most progressive country as regards locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F William Felton’s book shows the great improvements
that had taken place in English carriage-building
during the latter half of the eighteenth
century, William Bridges Adams’s <i>English Pleasure
Carriages</i>, published in 1837, sufficiently shows the
enormous improvements which had followed upon
Obadiah Elliott’s invention of the elliptic springs.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>the first place you had a whole series of light, perchless
carriages being built, and in the second you had the new
macadamised roads upon which to run them.</p>

<p>In treating of all these various carriages, it is difficult
to know where to begin. A mere catalogue with a few
lines of description cannot be very satisfactory, and yet
there seems no other method to adopt. Bridges Adams,
who was a coachbuilder himself and the inventor of
several novel carriages, is a good guide, but one could
have wished that his book had been illustrated by anything
rather than those fearsome diagrams which mean
so little to any one but a coachbuilder himself. From
the beginning of the century, indeed, illustrations of
carriages began to take on that diagrammatic aspect
which the trade-papers still maintain; while at the same
time the old prints and caricatures began to disappear.
It is a pity, but it cannot be helped.</p>

<p>“Though it would be difficult,” says Bridges Adams,
“to describe every particular variety of carriage now in
use, it is comparatively easy to set forth the leading
features&mdash;the original models, as it were, of each particular
class. The distinguishing characteristics are to be
found in the form of the bodies and not in the mechanism
of the springs or framework. Thus a particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>shaped body entitles the carriage to the term Chariot,
whether it be constructed with under springs or C springs,
or with both, or whether it be with or without a perch.
This rule obtains throughout the whole varieties of
carriages; and in those bodies which are formed by a
combination”&mdash;as now began to be the case&mdash;“it is customary
to call them by a double name&mdash;as Cab-Phaeton,
Britzschka-Chariot, Britzschka-Phaeton, &amp;c.” Accordingly,
I shall endeavour in a brief catalogue to point out
such changes as were being made in each broad class of
vehicle.</p>

<p>The coach was still being made with a perch. It was
not hung so high, but in other respects it differed but
little from its predecessors. The Salisbury boot, which
carried the coachman’s seat, and the hammercloth,
were still used, but for travelling long distances were
removed, a smaller platform being substituted in their
place. In the <i>Driving Coach</i>, a novelty which now
became popular with gentlemen of means, and at a later
date came to be commonly known as the <i>four-in-hand</i>,
the wheels were rather nearer together, and the perch
was short and straight. This had the boots which, as
we have seen, had been already added to the mail-coaches
for the convenience of outside passengers.
“The boots and body,” says Bridges Adams, “are
framed together, and suspended on springs before and
behind&mdash;the connection with the carriage being by
means of curved blocks.”</p>

<p>Another variety of the coach was the <i>barouche</i>, which,
though, I suppose, not technically a coach at all, if one
accepts Thrupp’s definition&mdash;for it was roofless&mdash;is
generally classed with this kind of vehicle. There had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
been, I believe, a barouche in England so early as 1767,
but it was not popular until a much later date. The
barouche was simply a coach-body without its upper
portion&mdash;an open carriage, that is to say, with high
driving seat, and a hood fixed to the back if required&mdash;not
indeed unlike an opened landau to look at. It was
purely a town carriage. Its driving seat, similar to that
in a landau, was built to hold both coachman and footman,
“the hinder part being unprovided with a standard,
which would,” says Bridges Adams, “be useless, as
when the head is down there is little convenience
for the servant’s holders, and he would moreover be
unpleasantly placed, looking down on the sitters within,
and listening to all the conversation,” a matter of course
which he would have been only too pleased to do.
The barouche would hold four or six persons, and in
fine weather was considered to be “the most delightful
of all carriages.” There was, too, a certain amount of
state about it, and several noble families continued to
drive in them long after most other people had given
them up. When Ackermann, the publisher, invented
his patent movable axles about 1816, the barouche was
one of the carriages to which these axles were fitted.
A print of this carriage is shown in the accompanying
illustration. A <i>barouchet</i>, corresponding to the landaulet,
was also built at this time, but was never popular.
Bridges Adams speaks of it as a graceless carriage for
one horse.</p>

<p>The town chariot, or <i>coupé</i>, as it was called in France,
and indeed, at a later date in England, was being built
lower than before, but otherwise remained unaltered.
The high driving seat was still removed to transform the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
carriage into a post-chaise. Amusing instructions for
buying a chariot are given by John Jervis, an old
coachman, in the second volume of the <i>Horse and
Carriage Oracle</i>, 1828. “The form of Carriages,” he
opines, “is as absurdly at the Mercy of Fashion, as the
Cut of a Coat is&mdash;however, if the Reader is willing to
let the Builder please himself with the form of the
Exterior, he will not be quite so polite as to submit the
construction of the Interior entirely to the caprice of
his Coachmaker.” Don’t, he advises, have too much
stuffing inside: “<i>The present fashion of Stuffing</i> is preposterous,
it reduces a Large Body to the size of a
small One: however,” he adds obligingly, “if you like
to ride about for the benefit of public inspection, as
your friends, my <i>Lady Look-out</i>, the <i>Widow Will-be-seen</i>&mdash;and
<i>Sir Simon Stare</i>, do, pray, study Geoffrey Gambado
on the Art of sitting politely in Carriages, with the most
becoming attitudes, &amp;c., and choose wide Door Lights
and full Squabbing;&mdash;if you wish to go about peaceably
and quietly, like <i>Sir Solomon Snug</i>, and are contented
with seeing without being seen, adopt the contracted
Lights, and common Stuffing, which, among others, have
this great advantage that when you sit back, you may
have the side Window down, and a thorough Air passing
through the Carriage, without it blowing directly in
upon you: this, to Invalids who easily catch Cold, is
very important.” The lining of the chariot, he recommends,
should be “green, with Lace to correspond, and
the Green <i>silk Sun Shades</i> of the same Colour,” green
being pleasant to the eye. Venetian blinds, he says, are
very nice in warm weather, and should be painted
verdigris green on the inside and on the outside a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
colour which matches with that of the coach-body.
Further instructions follow. You are advised never
to permit officious strangers to shut your carriage
door&mdash;a piece of sound advice which might well be
followed to-day when seedy people expect a small tip
for having watched you get into a cab&mdash;and if your
coachman sees any one about to do so, he is to say
“loudly and imperatively, ‘<i>Don’t meddle with the
Door!</i>’”</p>

<p>The chief maker of these chariots was the celebrated
Samuel Hobson, “who may be truly said to have
improved and remodelled every sort of carriage, which
came under his notice, especially as regards the artistic
form and construction, both of body and carriage.”
“Hobson’s Chariots,” indeed, were in a class by themselves.
“He lowered the wheels of coaches and
chariots,” says Thrupp, “to 3 ft. 3 in. in front and
4 ft. 5 in. behind, and lengthened the carriage part once
more to such a true proportion to the whole vehicle as
has approved itself as correct to each succeeding generation
of Coachbuilders and users of carriages. He
lowered the body, too, so that it could be entered by
a moderate double step instead of the three-fold ladder
previously in use.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jervis’s remarks about the coachmaker’s being
allowed to choose the exterior of his customer’s carriage
no doubt followed on the practice, mentioned by Bridges
Adams, of building particular carriages upon a general
chariot basis. Of these hybrids, perhaps the most popular
was the <i>Briska-chariot</i>. The briska itself (more correctly
the <i>britzschka</i>) had been introduced into England from
Austria about 1818 by Mr. T. G. Adams, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>Bridges Adams thinks that it was first brought here at a
rather later date by the Earl of Clanwilliam, “who liked
it for its lightness; for which reason it probably obtained,
amongst coachmen and mechanics, the translated name
<i>Brisker</i> or <i>Brisky</i>.” In England it was made in various
sizes and with various modifications. A small one for
one horse was “a light open carriage, fitted with a
leathern top over the front inside seat; which top had
a glazed front and sides, or glazed front and Venetian
blinds to the sides.” Its chief characteristics were a
small seat at the back of the main body and
a straight bottom line to the body itself&mdash;this giving it
“a ship-like and fast-going appearance.” Ten years
after its introduction it was so immensely popular as to
threaten every other carriage; nor was this altogether
surprising, for in addition to being liked for the sake of
its own lightness, it lent itself so well to every variety
of purpose. And of these modified briskas, the <i>briska-chariot</i>
was one of the most favoured. It was in
particular demand with those travelling abroad, inasmuch
as its great length enabled its passengers to lie at full
length. Another variety, the <i>droitzschka</i> or <i>drosky</i>, was
a modification of the Russian vehicle of that name.
This was built low, an open perch carriage with a hood,
used chiefly by “languid, aged, or nervous persons, and
children.” The drosky seems to have given the idea to
Mr. David Davies for his <i>pilentum</i>, which was
very similar in appearance. This Mr. Davies is also
supposed to have been the inventor of the popular
<i>cab-phaeton</i>, a one-horse, low-hung carriage suspended
on four elliptic springs. On the Continent this carriage
became known as a <i>milord</i>, once most aristocratic, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
by 1850 little better than a hack. It was somewhat
similar in appearance to the <i>victoria</i>.</p>

<p>The phaeton was still made, but was being superseded
by the briska. The main seat of the carriages, as in the
old perch-high phaetons, was still over the front axle,
but the body was now hung low on elliptic springs.
Such a perchless carriage was called by Adams “the very
simplest form of wheeled vehicle in ordinary use. It is
literally a long box, with an arm-chair in front, and
a bench behind.” And that is a remarkably good
description. Here, too, as with the chariots, there were
also various hybrids.</p>

<p>Landaulets were very popular in London, and
were made in great quantities by the firm with which
Obadiah Elliott himself was connected. A patent roof
and Ackermann’s movable axles are shown in the
accompanying illustration of this carriage.</p>

<p>We come now to the two-wheeled carriages. Of these
the most fashionable was still the curricle, though Bridges
Adams considered the shape of the body “certainly
unsightly.” It is interesting to notice in this connection
that the mode of attaching the two horses to the
curricle was “precisely that of the classic car, only more
elegant.” It was in a curricle that Charles Dickens rode
about so soon as he was able to afford the luxury of a
private carriage. The <i>cabriolet</i>, somewhat similar to it
in form, was simply the old one-horse chaise brought up
to date. The body resembled a nautilus shell, thus
differing from the popular two-wheeled carriage called a
<i>tilbury</i>. This had been built first by a carriage-maker
of the same name. It was constructed without a boot
(or hind seat) and was a very light carriage, with,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
however, rather too much ironwork and too many springs&mdash;seven
in all&mdash;about it. Italy and Portugal seem to have
taken to this particular gig and numerous consignments
were sent south by water. Another vehicle, not very
different, was the <i>stanhope</i>, also built by Tilbury to the
order of the Hon. Fitzroy Stanhope, a brother of Lord
Petersham. This was much like the old rib chair, but
hung from four springs. The only difference, so far as
the shape of their bodies goes, between the tilbury and
the stanhope is to be found in the fact that in the stanhope
it is rather larger and more capacious. The <i>dennet</i>,
invented by a Mr. Bennett of Finsbury, had a body
resembling that of a phaeton. It had three springs, and
Bridges Adams, without being certain upon the point,
thinks that it took its name from these three springs,
which were named after the three Misses Dennet, “whose
elegant stage-dancing was so much in vogue about the
time the vehicle was first used.” The lightest of all these
carriages, however, was the common gig, such as that
arch-joker, Theodore Hook, was accustomed to drive
in, which at this time was “simply an open railed chair,
fixed on the shafts, and supported on two side springs, the
harder ends of which were connected to the loop irons
by leathern braces&mdash;to give more freedom to the motion.”
Small alterations in the gig, such as the addition of a
deep boot and Venetian blinds to the lockers (to carry
dogs) led to the first <i>dog-cart</i>. Here the passengers sat
back to back. <i>Tandem-carts</i> were very similar, though
here the driver’s seat was raised. The dog-cart itself
gave rise to numerous varieties, such as the <i>Newport</i>, the
<i>Malvern</i>, the <i>Whitechapel</i>, the <i>sliding body</i>, and the
<i>Norwich</i> carts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>In America the <i>buggy</i>, a light waggon, the <i>sulky</i>, the
<i>fantail gig</i>, the <i>tub-bodied gig</i>, the <i>chariotee</i>, and the
<i>public sociable</i> were the chief carriages. The <i>rockaway</i>,
made first in 1830, was a light waggon with wooden
springs on the outside of the body. The <i>volante</i>, much
used at this time by the Spanish ladies of South America
and Cuba, was a hooded gig upon two high wheels. But
in America, as in Europe, no entirely new bodies or
methods of framing were needed, and such little differences
as there were are only of interest to the coachbuilder
or the expert.</p>

<p>Before passing, however, to the public conveyances, to
which, it would seem, most carriage-builders of an
inventive turn were now giving their attention, I may
mention one or two particularly quaint or fanciful
carriages which do not readily fall into a recognised
class.</p>

<p>About this time several people seem to have been at
pains to produce a three-wheeled carriage, “apparently
designed,” says Croal, “to overcome an element of
danger in the ordinary two-wheeled gig, in which so
much of the business and pleasure of travelling took
place.” In America, the chief experiments in this
direction were made by Dr. Nott, president of Union
College at Schenectady, who produced a three-wheeled
chariot, in which he drove about.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> “The body of the
vehicle was supported by the near axle on two wheels,
while a third wheel in front was in close connection with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>the shafts, so that it revolved with them as they turned.
By this arrangement the body of the carriage could be
hung low, supported entirely by the wheels, while the
third wheel in front, revolving in a small circle with the
shaft, enabled the occupants to make a short and safe
turn.” What became of this weird vehicle is not
known, but its inventor’s memory was enshrined in a
song, one verse of which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Where, oh where, is the good old Doctor?</div>
<div class="line">Where, oh where, is the good old Doctor?</div>
<div class="line">He went up in the Three Wheel Chariot,</div>
<div class="line">Safe into the Promised Land!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A six-wheeled carriage was also proposed by Sir
Sidney Smith. Here, as in Bridges Adams’s various
equirotal carriages (never successful and particularly
ugly, so far as the pictures of them are concerned), the
wheels were all of equal size. Great things were
promised of it, but that was all. The question, however,
of safety carriages was being very widely considered.
Accidents must have been all too frequent.
Runaway horses and high gigs between them were constantly
bringing the more reckless drivers to an untimely
end. In 1825 a good proposal was made for a safety
gig, which was to have a contrivance fixed to the shafts
so that they should remain in a horizontal position,
whether the horse were between them or not. Experiments
were also made with some such contrivance
as Sir Francis Delavel had first tried with his eighteenth-century
phaeton. And then came a time when almost
every coachbuilder had some “pet dodge” with which
the dangers of travelling were supposed to be reduced
to a minimum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>In Ireland, where at a very early date a rough, flat-boarded
waggon on two solid wheels had been used for
passenger-traffic&mdash;in which case the passengers sat on
the boards back to back with their legs dangling over
the sides&mdash;a peculiar vehicle called a <i>noddy</i> was now
popular. A writer in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> for 1826
speaks of this carriage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A chaise and pair, miserable in show and substance
as both really were, was a species of luxurious conveyance
to which the ambition of the middle class of
travellers in Ireland before 1800 never ventured to
aspire. Such as were content with a less dignified mode
of travelling on wheels, the city of Dublin accommodated
with a vehicle unparalleled, I believe, in any part of the
world, and singular in name as well as construction.
It was called a <i>Noddy</i>, drawn by one horse, and carrying
two, or if not of overgrown dimensions, three passengers.
The body of this ‘leathern convenience,’ which
bore some resemblance to an old-fashioned phaeton,
‘beetled o’er its base’ in front, the better to protect the
inmates; and being slung from cross-bars by strong
braces instead of springs, nodded formidably at every
movement of the horse, hence deriving the appropriate
appellation of Noddy. In case of rain blowing in,
a curtain of the same material afforded its friendly
shelter, wrapping the passengers in total darkness,
though, as far as the prospect was concerned, the inconvenience
was little; the only visible object when it was
withdrawn being the broad back and shoulders of the
brawny driver, who rested his legs upon the shaft, and
his sitting part on a sort of stool a very little way
removed from the knees of the person seated within.
Simple, awkward, and uneasy as this contrivance was,
it was not disdained even by senators at an earlier
period than that of which I write; and a nobleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
some thirty years older than myself, too, of high rank
and large estate, assured me that it was his usual conveyance
to and from college accompanied by a trusty servant
or private tutor.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The ordinary <i>jaunting car</i> and the larger <i>bian</i>&mdash;the
invention of Bianconi, a rich tradesman in Dublin,
though for many years an itinerant dealer&mdash;hardly
differed in points of construction from English carriages,
though the passengers sat back to back on a seat that ran
parallel to the shafts.</p>

<p>In Wales the <i>market cart</i> was even more primitive
than the noddy of Ireland. This was a low, two-wheeled,
springless box of an affair, in which you sat
as best you could on the boards. There was no covering
at all. A rail at the back, extending some way along
the sides, helped to prevent you from falling out behind,
if the horse gave a sudden lurch forward.</p>

<p class="tb">Whilst European carriages were thus taking on a
soberer aspect, Eastern coaches were maintaining all
their old magnificence. The Maharajah of Mysore, to
take one instance, travelled in a truly marvellous elephant
carriage in the early years of the nineteenth century.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Its interior was a double sofa for six persons,
covered with dark green velvet and gold, surmounted
by an awning of cloth of gold, in the shape of two
small scalloped domes, meeting over the centre, and
surrounded by a richly ornamented verandah, supported
by light, elegant, fluted gilt pillars. The whole was
capable of containing sixty persons, and was about
twenty-two feet in height. It moved on four wheels,
the hinder ones eight feet in diameter, with a breadth of
twelve feet between them. It was drawn by six immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
elephants, an exact match in size, with a driver on each,
harnessed to the carriage by traces, as in England, and
their huge heads covered with a sort of cap made
of richly embroidered cloth. The pace at which the
elephants moved was a slow trot, of about seven miles
an hour&mdash;they were very steady, and the springs of
the coach particularly easy. The shape of the body was
that of an extremely elegant flat scallop-shell, painted
dark green and gold. This magnificent carriage was
the production of native workmen, assisted by a half-caste
Frenchman.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Even this vehicle, however, was eclipsed by the state
carriage of a ruling Burmese chief, captured by the
British in 1824. “This carriage presented one entire
blaze of gold, silver, and precious stones; the last-named
amounting to many thousands, including diamonds,
rubies, blue and white sapphires, emeralds,
amethysts, garnets, topazes, crystals, and the curious
and rare stones known as cat’s eyes. The carriage stood
nearly thirty feet in height,” and was drawn by elephants.
“In form and construction,” says Croal, “in
its elaborate and superior carving, and its grand and
imposing effect, this coach takes rank as one of the
most splendid equipages in existence.”</p>

<p class="tb">Many changes, meanwhile, were taking place in the
public carriages.</p>

<p>Of the mail-coaches I need say nothing at all. Numerous
books exist which retell all those romances of
the road which even in these days of motor-cars cannot
be altogether forgotten. The Golden Age of coaching
was at hand, and no print-shop is complete without some
score or more of carefully coloured engravings of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
or other of “the Mails.” They bore particular names&mdash;there
were Flying Machines and Telegraphs and the
like&mdash;and they were larger than in the days when
Palmer had inaugurated the system, but that was all.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Coming to such public vehicles, however, as were in
general confined to the metropolis, we find many changes.</p>

<p>The old hackney-coaches still plied for hire. They
had their particular stands, and the fares were subject
to strict, though sometimes exceedingly quaint, regulations.
The first section of the new <i>Orders</i> issued in
1821 may be quoted as bearing upon the structure of
the hackneys.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is ordered, constituted, and ordained, that, from
and after the four-and-twentieth Day of <i>June</i> next
ensuing the Day of the Date of these Presents, the
Perch of every Coach shall be Ten Feet long at the
least; and such Coach [shall] have cross Leather Braces
before, and not braced down, but shall hang upon a
Level, and not higher behind than before, and to be</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>decent, clean, strong, and warm, with Glass Windows
on each Side, or Shutters with Glasses of Nine Inches
in Length, and Six Inches in Breadth in each Shutter;
and large enough to carry Four Persons conveniently;
and the Horses to every such Coach shall be able and
sufficient for the Business when such Coach and Horses
come from Home, to Ply; on a Penalty not exceeding
Ten Shillings, at the Discretion of the said Commissioners,
to be paid by the Owner of the License, if the
same be not rented out, and in Case the same shall be
rented out, then upon a Renter thereof.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Leigh Hunt could find little good to say of them.
Says he, quoting from a supposititious poetess:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i26">“Thou inconvenience! thou hungry crop</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Dickens was familiar with these hackneys, and in one
of the <i>Sketches by Boz</i> draws a picture of them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Take a regular, ponderous, rickety, London hackney-coach,
of the old school, and let any man have the
boldness to assert, if he can, that he ever beheld any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
object on the face of the earth which at all resembles
it unless, indeed, it were another hackney-coach of the
same date. We have recently observed on certain
stands, and we say it with deep regret, rather dapper
green chariots, and coaches of polished yellow, with four
wheels of the same colour as the coach, whereas it is
perfectly notorious to every one who has studied the
subject, that every wheel ought to be of a different
colour, and a different size. These are innovations,
and, like other miscalled improvements, awful signs
of the restlessness of the public mind, and the little
respect paid to our time-honoured institutions. Why
should hackney-coaches be clean? Our ancestors found
them dirty, and left them so. Why should we, with a
feverish wish to ‘keep moving,’ desire to roll along
at the rate of six miles an hour, while they were content
to rumble over the stones at four? These are solemn considerations.
Hackney-coaches are part and parcel of the
law of the land; they were settled by the Legislature;
plated and numbered by the wisdom of Parliament.</p>

<p>“Then why have they been swamped by cabs and omnibuses?
Or why should people be allowed to ride quickly
for eightpence a mile, after Parliament had come to the
solemn decision that they should pay a shilling a mile
for riding slowly? We pause for a reply&mdash;and, having
no chance of getting one, begin a fresh paragraph....</p>

<p>“There is a hackney-coach stand under the very
window at which we are writing; there is only one
coach on it now, but it is a fair specimen of the class
of vehicles to which we have alluded&mdash;a great, lumbering,
square concern, of a dingy yellow colour (like a bilious
brunette), with very small glasses, but very huge frames;
the panels are ornamented with a faded coat of arms,
in shape something like a dissected bat, the axle-tree is
red, and the majority of the wheels are green. The
box is partially covered by an old great-coat, with a
multiplicity of capes, and some extraordinary-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
clothes; and the straw, with which the canvas cushion
is stuffed, is sticking up in several places, as if in rivalry
of the hay, which is peeping through the chinks in the
boot. The horses with drooping heads, and each with
a mane and tail as scanty and straggling as those of a
worn-out rocking-horse, are standing patiently on some
damp straw, occasionally wincing, and rattling the harness;
and now and then, one of them lifts his mouth
to the ear of his companion, as if he were saying in a
whisper, that he should like to assassinate the coachman.
The coachman himself is in the watering-house; and
the waterman, with his hands forced into his pockets
as far as they can possibly go, is dancing the ‘double
shuffle,’ in front of the pump, to keep his feet warm....</p>

<p>“Talk of cabs! Cabs are all very well in cases of
expedition, when it’s a matter of neck or nothing, life
or death, your temporary home or your long one. But,
besides a cab’s lacking that gravity of deportment which
so peculiarly distinguishes a hackney-coach, let it never
be forgotten that a cab is a thing of yesterday, and that
he never was anything better. A hackney-cab had
always been a hackney-cab, from his first entry into life;
whereas a hackney-coach is a remnant of past gentility,
a victim to fashion, a hanger-on of an old English
family, wearing their arms, and in days of yore, escorted
by men wearing their livery, stripped of his finery, and
thrown upon the world, like a once-smart footman when
he is no longer sufficiently juvenile for his office, progressing
lower and lower in the scale of four-wheeled
degradation, until at last it comes to&mdash;a <i>stand</i>!”</p></blockquote>

<p>These new cabs, indeed, were, as Dickens says, a
thing of yesterday, but they had had ancestors. Their
immediate forefathers came from Paris, where they had
been known for some time under the name of <i>cabriolets
de place</i>. Light two-wheeled carriages, these were, which
had been evolved quite naturally from the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
French gig of the seventeenth century. The popularity
of these cabriolets in Paris naturally led certain
enterprising people in London to attempt their importation,
but there was a difficulty to be surmounted.
The proprietors of the hackney-coaches had secured a
monopoly for carrying people in the streets of London.
In 1805, however, licences were obtained for nine
cabriolets, which thereupon started to run. In these
two passengers could be carried, and the driver sat side
by side with his fares.</p>

<p>They were not a great success. In the first place
they were not allowed except in certain areas, and in the
second passengers did not apparently appreciate the
close proximity of the driver. A number of years
passed before they either increased in numbers or caught
the public fancy. But in 1823, the Mr. Davies who had
designed the cab-phaeton built twelve new cabriolets, which
were put on to the streets for hire at the end of April.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘Cabriolets,’ runs a newspaper account, ‘were, in
honour of His Majesty’s birthday, introduced to the
public this [April 23rd] morning. They are built to
hold two persons inside besides the driver (who is
partitioned off from his company), and are furnished
with a book of fares for the use of the public, to prevent
the possibility of imposition. These books will be
found in a pocket hung inside the head of the cabriolet.
The fares are one-third less than hackney-coaches.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>These new cabs, painted yellow, had one novel feature
which must have astonished the inhabitants, for the
driver’s seat was a rather comical affair at the side&mdash;entirely
<i>outside</i> the hood. In this way privacy was
ensured, particularly if the curtains in front of the hood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
were drawn together. “The hood,” says Mr. Moore,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
“strongly resembled a coffin standing on end, and earned
for the vehicle the nickname of ‘coffin-cab.’” Cruikshank’s
picture of one of these, to illustrate a Sketch
by Boz, shows the curious shape of the hood very well.
In a short while these cabriolets became popular&mdash;there
were over one hundred and fifty of them in 1830&mdash;particularly
with the younger generation. A verse
of a then popular song mentions them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“In days of old when folks got tired,</div>
<div class="line">A hackney-coach or a chariot was hired;</div>
<div class="line">But now along the streets they roll ye</div>
<div class="line">In a <i>shay</i> with a cover called a <i>cabrioly</i>,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which hints at a slightly incorrect pronunciation! But
in a short while the cockney found it easier to say <i>cab</i>,
did so, and has done so ever since.</p>

<p>Dickens describes these cabs in his essay on the
London streets:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Cabs, with trunks and band-boxes between the
drivers’ legs and outside the apron, rattle briskly up
and down the streets on their way to the coach-offices
or steam-packet wharfs; and the cab-drivers and
hackney-coachmen who are on the stand polish up the
ornamental part of their dingy vehicles&mdash;the former
wondering how people can prefer ‘them wild beast cariwans
of homnibuses, to a riglar cab with a fast trotter,’
and the latter admiring how people can trust their necks
into one of ‘them crazy cabs, when they can have a ’spectable
’ackney cotche with a pair of ’orses as von’t run away
with no vun’; a consolation unquestionably founded on
fact, seeing that a hackney-coach horse never was known
to run at all, ‘except,’ as the smart cabman in front of the
rank observes, ‘except one, and he run back’ards.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>There is another sketch of Dickens which merits
quotation here. The two-wheeled cabs were, of course,
soon superseded by others of more modern appearance,
and Dickens speaks of the last of the cab-drivers and his
particular cab, with a few instructions upon riding in it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This cabriolet “was gorgeously painted&mdash;a bright
red; and wherever we went, City or West End,
Paddington or Holloway, North, East, West, or South,
there was the red cab, bumping up against the posts at
the street corners, and turning in and out, among
hackney-coaches, and drays, and carts, and waggons, and
omnibuses, and contriving by some strange means or
other, to get out of places which no other vehicle but
the red cab could ever by any possibility have contrived
to get into at all. Our fondness for that red cab was
unbounded. How we should have liked to have seen
it in the circle at Astley’s!...</p>

<p>“Some people object to the exertion of getting into
cabs, and others object to the difficulty of getting out
of them; we think both these are objections which take
their rise in perverse and ill-conditioned minds. The
getting into a cab is a very pretty and graceful process,
which, when well performed, is essentially melodramatic.
First, there is the expressive pantomime of every one
of the eighteen cabmen on the stand, the moment you
raise your eyes from the ground. Then there is your
own pantomime in reply&mdash;quite a little ballet. Four
cabs immediately leave the stand, for your especial
accommodation; and the evolutions of the animals who
draw them are beautiful in the extreme, as they grate
the wheels of the cabs against the curb-stones, and sport
playfully in the kennel. You single out a particular
cab, and dart swiftly towards it. One bound, and you
are on the first step; turn your body lightly round to
the right, and you are on the second; bend gracefully
beneath the reins, working round to the left at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
time, and you are in the cab. There is no difficulty in
finding a seat: the apron knocks you comfortably into
it at once, and off you go.</p>

<p>“The getting out of a cab is, perhaps, rather more
complicated in its theory, and a shade more difficult in
its execution. We have studied the subject a good
deal, and we think the best way is to throw yourself
out, and trust to chance for alighting on your feet. If
you make the driver alight first, and then throw yourself
upon him, you will find that he breaks your fall
materially. In the event of your contemplating an offer
of eightpence, on no account make the tender, or show
your money, until you are safely on the pavement. It
is very bad policy attempting to save the fourpence.
You are very much in the power of a cabman, and he
considers it a kind of fee not to do you any wilful
damage. Any instruction, however, in the art of getting
out of a cab is wholly unnecessary if you are going any
distance, because the probability is that you will be shot
lightly out before you have completed the third mile.</p>

<p>“We are not aware of any instance on record in
which a cab-horse has performed three consecutive miles
without going down once. What of that? It is all
excitement. And in these days of derangement of the
nervous system and universal lassitude, people are content
to pay handsomely for excitement; where can it be
procured at a cheaper rate?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thomas Hood also mentions both hackney-coaches
and cabs in one of his comic poems, <i>Conveyancing</i>.</p>

<p>While these cabs were still running, several experiments
were being made with patent carriages. One of
these, placed on the streets for a short while, was the
invention of Mr. William Boulnois. “It was a two-wheeled
closed vehicle,” says Mr. Moore, “constructed
to carry two passengers sitting face to face. The driver
sat on a small and particularly unsafe seat on the top of
it, and the door was at the back. It was, in fact, so
much like the front of an omnibus that it was well
known as the <i>omnibus slice</i>. Its popular name was the
<i>back-door cab</i>. Superior people called it a <i>minibus</i>.
This cab was quickly followed by a very similar, although
larger, vehicle invented by Mr. Harvey. It was called
a <i>duobus</i>.” These two cabs cannot have been very
comfortable; the shafts were too short, and the knowledge
that a possibly heavy coachman was sitting just
above your head seems to have militated against their
success.</p>

<p>Another cab, not wholly successful in itself, led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
way to the widely popular <i>hansom</i>. This was a carriage
invented in 1834 by Mr. Aloysius Hansom, the
architect of the Birmingham Town Hall. Here the
body was “almost square and hung in the centre of a
square frame.” The driver, as before, sat on the roof,
but had a small seat fixed there for his convenience.
The doors were in front, on either side of the driver’s
seat. And the wheels were of a prodigious height&mdash;being
seven feet six inches. Mr. Hansom, who had
obviously seen one of Francis Moore’s patent carriages
of 1790,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> himself drove this carriage from Hinckley in
Leicestershire to London, and found financial support
from Mr. Boulnois. Further experiments were made&mdash;in
one model you had to enter the carriage actually
<i>through</i> the wheels, the door being in this case at the
sides&mdash;and it was found that the wheels could be made
considerably smaller without danger or inconvenience.
Whereupon a company was formed to purchase the
invention for a sum of ten thousand pounds. Hansom,
however, obtained no more than three hundred, the
balance being used to perfect the far from satisfactory
cabs which had been placed on the streets. Such
improvements as were carried out were the work of
Mr. John Chapman,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> then secretary to the Safety Cabriolet
and Two-Wheel Carriage Company, who produced
a much safer vehicle, afterwards purchased by</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>Hansom’s company. This new cab was placed on the
streets in 1836, and proved such a success that it was
imitated by numerous other companies. Legal proceedings
were instituted, but proved both expensive and
not particularly successful, and the “pirate” cabs were
allowed to flourish as best they could.</p>

<p>Then, in 1836, was made the first of those four-wheeled
cabs,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> which were not really cabs at all, but
which will never be known by any other name. The
first of these was built by the ingenious Mr. Davies.
It bore superficial resemblance to the chariot. Two
passengers could ride inside, and a third on the box at
the coachman’s side. At this date the old two-wheeled
cabs were “a source of acknowledged disgrace, of many
alarming accidents, and of lamentable loss of life,” and
a company was formed to provide “a cheap, expeditious,
safe, and commodious mode of conveyance in lieu
of the present disgraceful and ill-conducted cabriolets.”
Two years later Lord Brougham was so pleased with
the appearance of these new cabs that he ordered one
for his own use. So was the first <i>brougham</i> constructed&mdash;the
earliest private four-wheeled closed carriage to be
drawn by a single horse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The original brougham,” says Sir Walter Gilbey,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
“differed in many particulars of design, proportion,
construction, and finish from the modern carriage. The
body ... was several inches wider in front than at
the back, and though both larger and heavier, was
neither so comfortable nor so convenient.... [It]
was held together by heavy, flat iron plates throughout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>and the front boot was connected with the front pillars
by strong outside iron stays, fixed with bolts. The
wheels were at once smaller in diameter and much
heavier. [The carriage] carried a large guard or ‘opera
board’ at the back of the body to protect the occupants
from risk of injury in a crush, when the pole of a carriage
behind might otherwise break through the back
panel&mdash;an accident now occasionally seen in our crowded
streets. Like all other carriages of the time there was
a sword case in the back panel for weapons. It was
painted olive green, a very fashionable colour at that
period.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another hansom, the <i>tribus</i>, may be noticed here,
though it was not invented until 1844. In this carriage
the driver’s seat was at the back on a level with
the roof, and the door to his left at the back&mdash;the
reason of this being that the driver could open or close
it without leaving his seat. Another peculiarity was
the presence of five windows, two in front, one at either
side, and a fifth at the back underneath the driver’s
seat. The <i>tribus</i> was the invention of Mr. Harvey,
who also built a <i>curricle tribus</i>, for two horses, but
neither was successful. The <i>quartobus</i> (1844) of Mr.
Okey, a four-wheeled vehicle to hold four inside passengers,
was likewise withdrawn after a short trial.</p>

<p>A word may here be said of the <i>omnibus</i>, which had
been introduced in 1819 into Paris, though not under
that name, by M. Jacques Laffitte. It was a modern
outcome of the old <i>gondola</i>. Nine years later the
modern name was given to it by M. Baudry, a
retired military officer. Laffitte had rivals, and ultimately
determined to triumph over them by building a
superior vehicle. At this time one of the most celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>coachbuilders in Paris was an Englishman, once
in the Navy, named George Shillibeer. To him came
Laffitte, and Shillibeer, whilst at work on the new conveyance,
conceived the idea of starting a similar one
in London. Accordingly he shipped one over and ran
it from Paddington to the Bank. This first omnibus of
his was a long, much be-windowed, four-wheeled carriage
with a door at the back, and not unlike a private omnibus of
to-day. A top-hatted coachman sat on a high seat in
front and drove three horses abreast. This was in 1819,
and from that time, in spite of the usual opposition,
these new and rather unsightly vehicles increased in
numbers until there were forty or fifty routes in
London alone upon which they were to be hourly seen.
A song sung with great success at a time when Shillibeer
was extending his operations, particularly in the direction
of Greenwich, whither it was proposed to run one
of the new railroads, may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE year of Queen Victoria’s Coronation saw
the successful opening of the London and
Birmingham Railway, and from that time all
but a few obstinate folk recognised the fact
that the horse as a necessary adjunct to cross-country
travelling was doomed. For some time, indeed, certain
ingenious gentlemen had been carrying out a number of
experiments with self-propelled carriages. Fifteen
years before, several inventors had produced cumbrous
machines which, without requiring rails, were able to
progress along the roads at speeds which compared
favourably with those attained by the ordinary coaches.
Sir Goldsmith Gurney&mdash;to mention, perhaps, the most
prominent of these men&mdash;had patented a steam-carriage
in 1827 which, in spite of attacks from an irate populace
who feared machinery as they feared the devil, was
quite successful enough to lead the enterprising Mr.
Hanning to ask for, and obtain, permission to run
similar machines on many of the principal roads of
England. Indeed, for a short while, there seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
have been a regular service of these primitive automobiles.
Many people, it is true, fought shy of
Gurney’s boilers, which in spite of the fact that they
had been “constructed upon philosophical principles”
occasionally exploded. It was after such an explosion
at Glasgow that Tom Hood seized the opportunity to
write the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Instead of <i>journeys</i>, people now</div>
<div class="line i1">May go upon a <i>Gurney</i>,</div>

<div class="line i04">“Tho’ with a load it may explode</div>
<div class="line i1">And you may all be undone;</div>
<div class="line">And find you’re going up to Heaven</div>
<div class="line i1">Instead of up to London.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Similarly, many people declared their intention of never
patronising the railroads. Steam, however, had come
to stay, and the days of coaching were already
numbered.</p>

<p>The net result of the new state of things, so far as
private carriages were concerned, seems to have been
that the coachbuilders set themselves to perfect the
urban vehicles, which became lighter, soberer, and more
various. New and less conventional “models” were
constantly being exhibited, while for those who could
not afford more than a single carriage adaptable bodies
were devised. So you might order a vehicle which with
small trouble could be entirely changed in appearance.
The older dignity, moreover, was giving place to a new
smartness. “Carriage people” still formed a class, but
families which before had been satisfied to use such
public conveyances as there had been, now drove forth
in one or other of the cheaper private carriages which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
were being constructed particularly for their convenience.
The dog-cart, for instance, had become common and
was undergoing various metamorphoses, and the
brougham was rapidly becoming the most popular of all
town vehicles. In country lanes, too, appeared the
waggonette and its kind. Nothing, indeed, was quite
so light as the American buggy with its shallow dish of
a body and its extraordinarily thin wheels, but there was
no longer that heaviness of line which gives to the older
carriages what is to modern eyes such an uncomfortable
appearance.</p>

<p>So in 1860 a London coachbuilder could write to the
American author of <i>The World on Wheels</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Ten years have completed a total revolution in the
carriage trade in England. Not only have the Court
and the nobility adopted economical habits, and insisted
on cheap carriages, but they carry no luggage, as was
formerly the case when carriages had to sustain great
weight, both of passengers and luggage. The cumbrous
Court carriages of former times are being gradually
abolished, and instead of the rich linings, laces, fringes,
and elaborate heraldry usual to the carriages of the
nobility, light vehicles, furnished only with a crest, are
used. The changes in construction, and consequent
depreciation of stock, were a heavy blow to the master
coachbuilders; many of the large houses must have lost,
in this manner, from ten to twenty thousand pounds.
The trade, having recovered from this blow, is in a
more healthy state. The favourite carriages in England
at this time were waggonettes, sociables, Stanhope and
mail phaetons, basket phaetons and landaus.”</p>

<p>I may speak first of the state or “dress” carriages.
“These vehicles,” says Thrupp, “had long passed the
period in which beautiful carving and elegant painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
had been used to disguise, as far as possible, the clumsy
state carriages of the eighteenth century. Ever since
the building of the Irish Lord Chancellor’s state coach
by Hatchett or Baxter in 1790, coachbuilders had
endeavoured to produce a graceful outline of body, of a
fair size no larger than was necessary; the C-springs
had been made of a perfect curve, the perch followed
the sweeps of the body, the carving was reduced to a
moderate amount, the ornamental painting was confined
to the stripes upon the wheels, and the heraldic bearings
of the owners of the carriages were beautifully emblazoned
on the panels. For further ornament they relied on
plated work in brass or silver round the body and on
loops and wheel hoops. In every capital of Europe
such carriages had superseded the old style, and London
and Paris had supplied other countries with most of
these state carriages.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At the Queen’s Coronation in 1838, Londoners had
a good opportunity of seeing these dress carriages, a
number of which early in the day were lined up in Birdcage
Walk. Most of these belonged to the various
ambassadors. The one which excited the widest
admiration belonged to Marshal Soult&mdash;a French-built
carriage, originally built for one of the Royal family.
Thrupp describes it. “The body had four upper
quarter glasses, with a very elegant deep and pierced
cornice of silver round the roof; there were four lamps
with large coronets on the tops, and the coach bore a
coronet on the roof also. The colouring of the painting
was a lovely blue, such as was then called Adelaide blue;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>this had been varnished with white spirit varnish,
and seemed almost transparent in lustre. The whole
coach was ornamented with silver and was finished in
great taste.” Other particulars of these carriages are to
be found in the contemporary newspaper reports. We
are told of the enormous prices paid. Count Strogonoff
purchased for £1600 the carriage which had originally
been built at a cost of £3000 by the Duke of Devonshire
for his state visit to St. Petersburg. Another
ambassador, finding that it was too late to buy a
carriage, hired one from one of the Sheriffs at a cost of
£250 for the occasion, which strikes one as an excessive

<p>Modern state carriages retain all their former
magnificence with little if any of the old cumbersome
and unnecessary ornament. One of the finest examples
of this kind of carriage is the state landau built for
King Edward and used by him in the Coronation
procession.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This magnificent example of the coachbuilder’s art,”
says Sir Walter Gilbey, “is over eighteen feet long.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>The body is hung upon C-springs by strong braces
covered with ornamentally stitched morocco; each
brace is joined with a massive gilt buckle with oak leaf
and crown device. Between the hind springs is a rumble
for two footmen; there is no driving seat, as the carriage
is intended to be drawn only by horses ridden postilion.
The panels are painted in purple lake considerably
brighter than is usual in order to secure greater effect;
marking the contours of the body and the outlines of the
rumble are mouldings in wood carved and gilt, the design
being one of overlapping oak leaves.</p>

<p>“The door panels, back and front panels, bear the
Royal Arms with crown, supporters, mantle, motto,
helmet, and garter. On the lower quarter panel is the
collar of the Order of the Garter, encircling its star and
surmounted by the Tudor crown. Springing in a slow,
graceful curve from the underpart of the body over the
forecarriage is a ‘splasher’ of crimson patent leather.
Ornamental brass lamps are carried in brackets at each of
the four corners of the body.</p>

<p>“As regards the interior of this beautiful carriage, it is
upholstered in crimson satin and laces which were woven
in Spitalfields; the hood is lined with silk, as better
adapted than satin for folding. The rumble is covered
with crimson leather. It is to be observed that with the
exception of the pine and mahogany used for the panels,
English-grown wood and English-made materials only
have been used throughout.</p>

<p>“While less ornate than the wonderful ‘gold coach’
designed by Sir William Chambers and Cipriani in 1761,
the new state landau, in its build, proportions, and
adornment, is probably the most graceful and regal
vehicle ever built.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption">George V’s State Carriage<br />(<i>From a Photograph</i>)</p></div>

<p>Other English state carriages hardly less successfully
designed have been made for the Lord Mayor of
London (1887), for Sir Marcus Samuel, when holding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>that position in 1902-3, for the Sheriffs, and for various
Indian Princes.</p>

<p>Coming to less pretentious vehicles, we may briefly
consider in the first place the coach proper. At the
time of Queen Victoria’s Coronation, coaches of the
old pattern were, of course, still being constructed.
There is in possession of Messrs. Holland and Holland
a mail-coach built by Waude, one of the best-known
coachbuilders of that time, which is typical of the
period. This, says Mr. Charles Harper,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“is substantially and in general lines as built in 1830.
The wheels have been renewed, the hind boot has a door
at the back, and the interior has been relined; but otherwise
it is the coach that ran when William IV was
King. It is a characteristic Waude coach, low-hung,
and built with straight sides, instead of the bowed-out
type common to the productions of Vidler’s factory.
It wears, in consequence, a more elegant appearance
than most coaches of that time; but it must be confessed
that what it gained in the eyes of the passers-by
it must have lost in the estimation of the insides, for
the interior is not a little cramped by those straight
sides. The guard’s seat on the ‘dickey’&mdash;or what in
earlier times was more generally known as the ‘backgammon-board’&mdash;remains,
but his sheepskin or tiger-skin
covering, to protect his legs from the cold, is gone.
The trap-door into the hind boot can be seen. Through
this the mails were thrust and the guard sat throughout
the journey with his feet on it. Immediately in front
of him were the spare bars, while above, in the still
remaining case, reposed the indispensable blunderbuss.
The original lamps in their reversible cases remain.
There were four of them&mdash;one on either forequarter,
and one on either side of the fore boot, while a smaller
one hung from beneath the footboard, just above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
wheelers. The guard had a small hand lamp of his
own to aid him in sorting his small parcels. The door
panels have apparently been repainted since the old days,
for although they still keep the maroon colour characteristic
of the mail-coaches, the Royal Arms are gone, and
in their stead appears the script monogram in gold,
V.R.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is the coach which of all vehicles has least changed its
appearance in the last hundred years. The drag of to-day
and the old coach just described differ from one another
only in a few minor details of construction. The reason
for this is not far to seek. “The brief ‘Golden Age,’”
says Sir Walter Gilbey, “of fast coaching saw the
vehicle, of which such hard and continuous work was
required, brought as near perfection as human ingenuity
and craftsmanship was capable of bringing it. No effort
was spared to make the mail or road-coach the best
possible conveyance of its kind, and in retaining the
model of a former age the modern coachbuilder confesses
his inability to improve upon the handiwork of
his progenitors.”</p>

<p>It is curious to note, by the way, that for a short
time such coaches were hardly made at all, and the
Report on the carriages shown at the London Exhibition
of 1862 speaks of the “revival of an almost
obsolete carriage, the four-in-hand coach, which had
taken place within a few years.” This was undoubtedly
due to the founding in 1856 of the Four-in-Hand
Driving Club.</p>

<p>Nor was this revival confined to England. In the official
<i>Reports upon Carriages</i> at the Paris Exhibition of 1878,
Mr. G. F. Budd draws attention to the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
“the French have closely adhered to the English styles
in the general design and shape of the bodies of their
vehicles, especially in broughams ... landaus ...
and drags. In the latter description of carriage, which
has become so popular during the last few years,
though it is peculiarly an English carriage, the style
has been closely followed, and with such considerable
success, that the French builders now appear as our
formidable rivals in this branch of the manufacture.”
“A novelty,” he continues, “in the design ... consists
in the roof being so constructed as to admit of being
opened in the centre ... a cover is placed on the top
of the two portions of the head thus opened, and so
forms, to all appearance, an ordinary luncheon-case with
the ends open: it thus serves the purpose of a table
when required ... and affords an increase of ventilation
to those riding inside the vehicle.” Similarly in
America drags began to be built after the establishment
of a driving club. These are identical with the English
models.</p>

<p>With regard to the other four-wheeled carriages, we
have now arrived at a period when it is almost impossible
to speak at any length of each particular kind.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
For in the first place such a classification as I have used
to describe the older vehicles must to a large extent
break down, and in the second place, from the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>when the great exhibitions did so much to make the
manufacturers of all nations familiar with each other’s
work, nearly every coachbuilder of standing has produced
one model, if not more, peculiar to itself. So,
in the middle of last century, you had carriages which
approximated to the barouche, yet which had been
evolved indirectly from so different a vehicle as the
phaeton. You saw carriages, obviously dissimilar in
appearance, yet bearing, to the layman, the same name.
You had new combinations of perches and springs.
And carriages were being exported from one country
to be improved upon the lines most suitable to the
roads and tastes of another.</p>

<p>Of all these carriages perhaps the two which deserve
most mention are the <i>landau</i> and the <i>victoria</i>, both
open carriages, which can be closed at will.</p>

<p>The <i>landau</i>, as I have said, had originally been a
coach made to open. At the beginning of the century
it had hardly been so popular as the <i>landaulet</i>, but at
this time it underwent several improvements at the
hands of Mr. Luke Hopkinson, a celebrated coachbuilder
of Holborn. It was Hopkinson who first built
what was known as a <i>briska-landau</i>, but he chiefly concerned
himself not so much with the shape of the
carriage-body as with the hood. He built his new
landaus in such a way as to allow the hood to be folded,
so that it lay horizontally at the back of the seat. At
the same time the floor and the seats were raised so
as to make the whole carriage a far more spacious and
comfortable vehicle than had been possible when the
hood could not be completely opened.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> And with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>hood entirely “down” you had practically the landau
of to-day, possibly the commonest carriage on the road.
Nearly every “fly” which so often is to be seen standing
rather forlornly outside the village station as your
train thunders past is a landau modelled on Hopkinson’s
designs. He was not, however, the only coachbuilder
whose attention was being given to this useful
carriage. Of one of the new landaus built by other
firms a trade journal of the day observed with some
truth that “its graceful outline and roominess” made
it “the very beau-ideal of vehicular luxury.” And as
the years passed the landau in its several varieties increased
in popularity. Improvements tended almost
solely in the direction of lightness. The Report on the
carriages at the exhibition of 1862 pays particular attention
to the landau. “The demand for them,” it runs,
“has ... increased. They are well suited to the
variable climate of the British Isles, as they can readily
be changed from an open to a closed carriage and vice
versa.” At a later exhibition&mdash;in 1885&mdash;the landau<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
had become so popular that there was actually shown
one, built for the Earl of Sefton, suited to the capabilities
of a single horse. This was an important departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>from tradition which seems to have shocked some of
the old-fashioned designers. “That an established
house with an aristocratic connection,” lamented one
trade paper at the time, “should exhibit a landau for
one horse would have been considered incredible
twenty years ago.” No doubt this was true, but people
persisted in their desire for light carriages, and a one-horse
landau was the natural outcome. At a later date
there was a tendency to alter the shape of the body.
Hitherto this had generally been angular; now the
lines became curving, the body, looked at from the side,
forming the arc of a huge circle. Such a carriage was
known as the <i>canoe landau</i>. To-day the canoe bodies, both
in England and abroad, are made rather deeper than at
the time of their introduction, but the square shape still
persists. If there is one English vehicle which may be
called the favourite carriage it is surely the landau.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_322.jpg" width="500" height="292" alt="Princess Victoria in her Pony Phaeton" />
<p class="caption"><i>Princess Victoria in her Pony Phaeton</i><br />(<i>From a Drawing by Lowes Dickinson, 1835</i>)</p></div>

<p>The earlier history of the <i>victoria</i>, the landau’s chief
rival, is rather obscure. As I have mentioned, the once
popular <i>cab-phaeton</i> was still to be seen in the ’forties in
many continental cities as the <i>milord</i>, which from a most
aristocratic vehicle had descended into the realms of
hackdom. An English coachbuilder, however, Mr.
J. C. Cooper, saw possibilities in such a vehicle and
prepared a series of designs. His drawings were scornfully
treated in England, but “found favour in the eyes
of his continental clients,” who about 1845 constructed
from them a four-wheeled cabriolet with seats for two.
This small open carriage was copied in more than one
place, particularly, it would seem, in Paris and Vienna.
Whether these copies were still called <i>milords</i> I am not
sure, but in 1856 they seem to have been described as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span><i>victorias</i>. In the meantime the pony phaeton had
become popular in England, and in 1851 a new model
designed for Her Majesty was, according to Stratton,
also called a victoria.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the summer of 1851,” he writes, “a unique little
pony phaeton was built by Mr. Andrews, of Southampton,
for the Queen. The original announcement stated
that when the carriage was delivered in front of the
palace in the Isle of Wight, ‘the Queen and Prince
expressed to Mr. Andrews their entire satisfaction with
the style, elegance, and extraordinary lightness and construction
of the carriage,’ which scarcely weighed three
hundredweight. The height of the fore wheels is only
eighteen inches, and of the hind ones thirty inches.
The phaeton is cane-bodied, of George IV style, with
movable head; the fore part is iron, but very light and
elegant and beautifully painted. This carriage is known
as the victoria, and has since been much improved in
England and America.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Stratton is probably right; but it was the French-built
carriage which the then Prince of Wales brought
to England in 1869 to which the name may be more
correctly ascribed. It is to be noticed, however, that
the pony phaeton and the victoria proper differ from
one another only in size and in the presence or absence
of a driver’s seat. The Prince of Wales’s carriage was
curved in shape and hooded, but about the same time
Baron Rothschild imported a victoria from Vienna of
the square shape. Both forms persist. At first, of
course, the victoria was looked on with suspicion, but
the Princess of Wales speedily showed her liking for it&mdash;it
did indeed make an ideal lady’s carriage&mdash;and in a
short while the world followed suit. “Light, low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
easy, fit for one horse, and looking very well behind a
pair of cobs,” remarks Thrupp, “it is not surprising
that the victoria meets with so much patronage.” At
first it would seem that the hood was not made to lie
flat, a fact amongst others which prompted a caustic
critic in 1877 to grumble at the conservatism of English
manufacturers. “Even with so good a model of this
carriage as that presented to them in the victoria,” he
wrote, “the English builders do not see fit to maintain
the same lines, and for some inscrutable reason deem
that the hood when down should rest at an angle;
whereas the ‘cachet’ of the Parisian equipages lies in
the absolute straight line it maintains with the horizon.”
Only a few years later, however, another critic was
drawing attention to the superiority of the English
victoria over its French counterpart. “Their rattle,”
he wrote of the latter, “is enough to distinguish them.
The French victoria is a low-mounted and decidedly
unsymmetrical machine. The pole [is] a foot longer
than it should be, the splinter bar and fore carriage too
low”&mdash;a criticism which holds good to-day with most of
the Italian carriages of this type.</p>

<p>Varieties of the victoria were constructed almost as
soon as the carriage had reached to any degree of
popularity. A hinge-seat was fitted into the front boot
to face the ordinary seat, and this not proving enough,
a permanent seat for two was built in its place, this
innovation giving rise to the double victoria, which was
built with or without doors. I need not, perhaps, dwell
further on the victoria, except to observe that such
changes as took place in the landau also took place in
its more delicate rival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>
<p>Another open carriage which remained popular until
the introduction of automobiles is the phaeton. Sir
Walter Gilbey mentions several varieties. Of these the
largest seems to have been the mail phaeton.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was a favourite carriage,” he writes, “seventy
years ago or more, and was frequently used by gentlemen
for long posting journeys in England and on the
Continent. In these days this carriage was always built
with a perch, the undercarriage resembling that of a
coach, whence its name. For a time elliptical springs
were adopted, but during the last ten years the fashionable
mail phaeton has been a solid-looking square-bodied
vehicle on its old undercarriage.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1889, he also observes that a jointed perch was
used, the object being “to prevent the vehicle being
twisted on bad roads, and also to preserve its equilibrium
under trying conditions of roads.” The <i>demi
mail phaeton</i>, to which Sir Walter gives the credit
of having ousted the ugly <i>perch high phaeton</i> from
public favour, “derives its names from the peculiar
arrangement of the springs in the construction
of the undercarriage.” Another variety, the <i>Beaufort
phaeton</i>, is large enough to carry six people, and was, in
the first place, expressly designed to carry people to the
meet. Yet another modification, the <i>Stanhope phaeton</i>,
invented by the peer of that name, is smaller than the
last-mentioned, and has achieved a world-wide popularity.
“The head and apron render it suitable for
winter work, and when the hood is thrown back the
stanhope is an admirable vehicle for summer use
whether in town or country.” The <i>T-cart</i> is a smaller
<i>stanhope</i> “with compassed rail and sticked body in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
front and a seat for the groom behind.” Sir Walter
records the fact that its greatest popularity was about
1888, after which it was supplanted by the <i>spider
phaeton</i>&mdash;a “tilbury body on four wheels with a small
seat for the groom supported on branched irons behind.”</p>

<p>It would be possible to mention half a dozen other
varieties of the phaeton,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> but such a list is best relegated
to a coachbuilder’s catalogue. There is only one
innovation which should not be allowed to pass unnoticed
here. Many of the phaeton bodies during the
’sixties were constructed of basket-work; indeed, Croydon,
where lived the inventor, received all the benefits
which a new industry brings in its trail, but the popularity
of these basket-carriages waned as rapidly as it
had waxed&mdash;due, according to one writer, to the ridicule
heaped upon them by <i>Punch</i>. A revival was
attempted in 1886, and “we have a reminiscence of it
in the imitation cane-work painted on the panels of
many carriages” at a still later date.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>We come to the closed carriages.</p>

<p>The <i>brougham</i> was undergoing about as many changes
and improvements as fell to the lot of any other carriage,
yet superficially it maintained much the same appearance.
The coupé brougham so popular to-day is the relic
of the old chariot.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> Of its several varieties the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>-known
is, or rather was&mdash;for it is rarely, if ever, seen
now&mdash;the <i>clarence</i>. “It was introduced,” says Sir
Walter, “about the year 1842 by Messrs. Laurie and
Marner, of Oxford Street, and has fairly been described
as “midway between a brougham and a coach.” It had
very curved and rather fanciful lines, seated four persons
inside, and was entered by one step from the
ground, carried the coachman and footman on a low
driving seat, and was used with a lighter pair of horses
than the family coach.” Certain models, however, show
the driver’s seat to have been high, on a level, that is to
say, with the roof; and not long after the first clarence
was designed, Lytton Bulwer caused to be built what
was called a <i>Surrey clarence</i>, which possessed a hammercloth.
The attempt, however, to produce a miniature
chariot did not succeed. Another variety, named uncomfortably
the <i>dioropha</i>, was shown at the Great
Exhibition of 1851.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Here the side windows would
slide up and down upon a new principle, and “the
whole upper part of the body from the elbow-line could
be lifted from the lower, leaving a barouche body.”
You were shown models of this upper portion hanging
rather forlornly from the roof of a coach-house. But
improvements in the landau caused the extinction of the
<i>dioropha</i>, which does not seem to have been built after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>1875. The <i>amempton</i>, invented by a Mr. Kesterton,
was a smaller form of this carriage. The one-horse
“growler” or “four-wheeler,” by the way, which still
wanders up and down the streets of London, is the
lineal descendant of the <i>clarence</i>.</p>

<p>Of the more unconventional four-wheeled carriages,
the waggonette seems to have been introduced about
1845 by the Prince Consort after a German model,
though one writer gives the credit of the design to the
Prince himself. Here, as every one knows, the seats
faced each other at right-angles to the driver’s seat, the
door being at the back. At first they were built very
large&mdash;to carry out the original intention of providing a
<i>family</i> carriage which should really be worthy of the
name. Afterwards smaller models were produced, and
proved equally popular. “The principle of riding sideways,”
remarks Thrupp, “was not new. The Irish car,
the four-wheeled Inside car of the Westmorland district,
the old Break, and the Omnibus all contributed
to the design of the modern vehicle.” A few particular
varieties may be mentioned. The now forgotten
<i>perithron</i>, a Suffolk invention, was a waggonette in
which the driving seat was bisected down its centre, so
as to allow a passenger entering from the back to reach
the front seat. The <i>Portland waggonette</i>, built for the
Duke of Portland in 1893, was a large carriage with a
folding hood. Another carriage of the kind with a
folding leather hood was presented by Lord Lonsdale
to the King and Queen at the time of their wedding.
This is known as a <i>Lonsdale waggonette</i>. “Lord Lonsdale,”
remarks Sir Walter Gilbey, “allowed his name to
be given to this device under the impression that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
the first to originate a head of this description; but his
claim for invention of it was disputed at the time. Mr.
Robertson stated that he had built such a waggonette
so far back as 1864; Mr. Kinder had built one in
1865; and Messrs. Morgan stated that they had turned
out a similar vehicle before the year 1870.” A very
large waggonette, the <i>brake</i>, is a common enough object
to-day, and is built in various forms. Sometimes a
second seat is placed directly behind and parallel to the
driver’s seat. In some models these seats stretch back
throughout the length of the carriage, in which case it
is a <i>char-à-banc</i>. Awnings, permanent or temporary,
are generally provided.</p>

<p>In America the commonest four-wheeled carriage is
the light <i>wagon</i> or <i>buggy</i>, a name given in England to a
light two-wheeled, single-seated cart (also called a sulky<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>)
towards the end of the eighteenth century. The <i>buggy</i>
has one seat fixed on to a long, shallow tray; the <i>wagon</i>
is similar, but has two or more seats.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These American waggons,” says Thrupp, “were
modelled from the old German waggon, but they have
been so much improved as to be scarcely recognised.
The distinctive feature of the German waggon was a
light, shallow tray, suspended above a slight perch
carriage on two grasshopper springs placed horizontally
and parallel with and above the front and hind axle-tree;
on the tray one or two seats were placed, the
whole was light and inexpensive, and well adapted to a
new, rough country without good roads. These waggons
may still be found in Germany and Switzerland....</p>

<p>“American ingenuity was lavished upon these waggons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>and they have arrived at a marvel of perfection in lightness.
The two grasshopper springs have been replaced
with two elliptical springs. The perch, axle-trees, and
carriage timbers have been reduced to thin sticks. The
four wheels are made so slender as to resemble a spider’s
web; in their construction of the wheels the principle
of the patent rim used in England in 1790 has been
adopted. Instead of five, six, or seven felloes to each
wheel, there are only two, of oak or hickory wood, bent
to the shape by steam. The ironwork of the American
buggy is very slender, yet composed of many pieces,
and, in order to reduce the cost, these pieces of iron are
mostly cast, not forged, of a sort of iron less brittle than
our cast iron.... The weight of the whole waggon is
so small that one man can lift it upon its wheels again if
accidentally upset, and two persons of ordinary strength
can raise it easily from the ground. The four wheels
are nearly of the same height, and the body is suspended
centrally between them. There are no futchels; the
pole or shafts are attached to the front axle-tree bed, and
the front of the pole is carried by the horses just as
they carry the shafts; the splinter-bar and whipple-trees
are attached to the pole on swivels. Some are made
without hoods and some with hoods. These are made
so that the leather of the sides can be taken off and
rolled up, and the back leather removed, rolled, or
fixed at the bottom, a few inches away from the back,
the roof remaining as a sunshade....</p>

<p>“The perfection to which the American buggy or
waggon has been carried, and every part likely to give
way carefully strengthened, is marvellous. Those made
by the best builders will last a long time without repair.
The whole is so slender and elastic that it ‘gives’&mdash;to
use a trade term&mdash;and recovers itself at any obstacle.
The defect in English eyes of these carriages consists in
the difficulty of getting in or out by reason of the height
of the front wheel, and its proximity to the hind wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>&mdash;it
is often necessary partly to lock round the wheel to
allow of easy entrance. There is also a tremulous
motion on a hard road which is not always agreeable.
It is not surprising that, with the great advantages of
extreme lightness, ease, and durability, and with lofty
wheels, the American waggons travel with facility over
very rough roads, and there is a great demand for them
in our colonies. It must be remembered that the price
is small, less than the price of our gigs and four-wheeled
dog-carts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the tourist in America will come away with
the impression that there is hardly a family in the continent
which does not possess at least one buggy or
waggon. They can be driven, too, at a very great pace.
In this connection it is interesting to notice that it was
a buggy which Lord Lonsdale selected in order to carry
out his great driving feat in 1891, when “he undertook
to drive four stages of five miles within an hour, using
for the first three stages one, a pair, a team, and riding
postilion in the fourth.”</p>

<p>There are, of course, many varieties, several invented
after Thrupp wrote the above account. Of these some
are peculiar to a particular State, while others seem to
be in general use throughout the continent. In Chicago,
for instance, and other towns of the middle west, the
commonest buggy seems to be the <i>bike wagon</i>, of which
a variety is the <i>cut-under bike wagon</i>, where the tray is
double&mdash;the seat forming a bridge between its two parts.</p>

<p>Stanhopes and phaetons are also manufactured in
America, though on a much lighter scale than in England.
Another popular American carriage is the <i>surrey</i>, which
has the two-seated arrangements of the larger waggons,
but is without the tray. The <i>station wagon</i>, very popu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>lar
in New England, resembles the old English chariot,
and differs from it only in its driving seat, which is on a
level with the inside seat and directly against the front
lines of the carriage-body. This is one of the most
comfortable carriages in the country. The <i>buckboard</i>,
even slenderer than the buggy, is hardly more than the
skeleton of a carriage, but seems none the less popular
on that account. The <i>barge</i> is the name given in Massachusetts
to a two-seated waggon, and the word has a
curious origin. It seems probable that it is a relic of
the days when in that part of the country the boat
sleighs used in the winter were put upon wheels in the
summer. At a later date ordinary waggons were used
for summer traffic, but the old name stuck. And I dare
say there are a dozen or more local names of some
peculiarity in other parts of America which to-day are
given to carriages not in the least like those to which
the name was originally applied.</p>

<p>Coming to the two-wheeled carriages, we find similar
changes to those described above showing themselves.
The old curricle, for instance, is now but rarely seen, its
place being taken by one or other of the dog-carts.
What was probably the most fashionable of these
carriages during the early Victorian era is now practically
extinct. This was the <i>cabriolet</i>, rather different in
appearance from the vehicles of that name which had
plied for hire but a few years before, yet built on the
same principles as the earliest French gigs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They were greatly improved,” wrote Mr. G. N.
Hooper in 1899,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> “about fifty years ago by the well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>known
Count D’Orsay and the late Mr. Charles B.
Courtney, who greatly refined the outlines and proportions,
making them lighter, more compact, and far more
stylish. They became <i>par excellence</i> the equipage of
the <i>jeune noblesse</i>, and no more stylish two-wheel
carriages for one horse were driven for many years
while they were fashionable. A large, well-bred horse
was a necessity, and this the cabriolet generally had.</p>

<p>“The groom, or ‘tiger’ as he was then called, was a
special London product: he was produced in no other
city, British or foreign; all the genuine tigers hailed
from London. His age varied from fifteen to twenty-five.
Few there were that were not perfect masters of
their horses, were they never so big. In shape and
make he was a man in miniature, his proportions perfect,
his figure erect and somewhat defiant: his coat fitted as
if it had been moulded on him; his white buckskin
breeches were spotless; his top-boots perfection; his
hat, with its narrow binding of gold or silver lace, and
brims looped up with gold or silver cord, brilliant with
brushing, was worn jauntily. As he stood at his horse’s
head, ready to receive his noble master, you might
expect him to say, ‘My master is a duke, and I am
responsible for his safety.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>There is little enough to say of the gigs. The
curricle, as I have said, is now rarely seen, though Sir
Walter Gilbey mentions a particular one introduced
about 1883 “which differed materially from the vehicle
formerly known by that name. It consisted of a
cabriolet, or whisky body, having an ‘ogee’ or chair
back, the body being suspended by braces from C or S
springs upon the undercarriage. Its peculiarity lay in
the use of long lancewood shafts, set so far apart that the
pole could be placed between them; the saddle-bar
being used to support the pole, the shafts, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
seem, were somewhat unnecessary.” The <i>Cape cart</i>
brought into England from South Africa is a two-wheeled
vehicle of this class with a pole in place of
shafts, and “the sides being framed so as to present
three panels.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At the back,” says Sir Walter, “was built in a large
box for provisions, the full width and depth of the cart,
the back seat forming the lid; the tail-board was used
only as a foot-rest. An adjustable centre seat with backrest
could be used so as to provide accommodation for
six passengers. A white canvas tilt on wooden hoops
with sunblinds at the sides, which could be strapped
up when not wanted, covered the whole body of the
cart.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And similar to the Cape cart is the <i>Whitechapel cart</i>,
which brings me to a brief consideration of the <i>dog-carts</i>.</p>

<p>As originally designed, the dog-cart seems to have
been built high, and, as its name implies, for the purpose
of carrying dogs. Such a vehicle would seat four, a
roomy, comfortable trap “with space under the seats,
where a brace of pointers or other dogs could lie at ease.”
As I have said in a preceding chapter, the sides of the
cart “were made with Venetian slats to provide
ventilation.” Such a cart, however, proved so agreeable
that no long time elapsed before its original purpose was
lost sight of, and it became one of the commonest of
country carriages. Built on a small scale it was admirably
suited for pony or cob. Numerous varieties exist.
In the <i>tandem cart</i>, as generally constructed, the driver’s
seat is high&mdash;the only cart, indeed, of the kind to maintain
any height at all. In the <i>Ralli cart</i> two seats are placed
back to back, the foot-rest to the latter closing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
body when required. (Built somewhat on the lines of
the ralli, by the way, is the Indian <i>tonga</i>, “a rather low,
hooded vehicle ... furnished for draught by a pair of
ponies on the curricle principle with pole and bar.”)
The <i>Battlesden</i>, <i>Bedford</i>, and <i>Malvern carts</i> are other
varieties. More popular, perhaps, than any of these is
the <i>governess cart</i>, which, while really in a class by itself,
may be mentioned here. This is a low and particularly
safe carriage, in which the seats are placed at the sides,
as in the waggonette, and the door is at the back. An
improvement on the governess cart, though not nearly
so popular, is the <i>Princess car</i>, first designed in 1893.
Here the back door is dispensed with, the entrance being
in front. “The driving seat is arranged on a slide,
whereby it can be moved forwards or backwards to
adjust the balance; and it also enables the driver to sit
facing the horse instead of sitting sideways as in the
governess cart.”</p>

<p>In the last chapter I pointed out the chief varieties of
public carriages. Of these the hansom and the omnibus
have undergone considerable changes. The hansom was
enormously improved by Mr. Forde, a Wolverhampton
coachbuilder, in 1873, when the Society of Arts offered
a prize for the best two-wheeled public conveyance.
Mr. Forde’s carriage was much lighter than the older
hansoms, and “its merits attracted the appreciative
attention of foreigners, whereby an export trade became
established.” Four years later another vehicle, the <i>two-wheeled
brougham</i>, was introduced, but did not meet with
success. The <i>Floyd hansom</i> of 1885 showed other
improvements, and for the first time the hansom became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
a private carriage. Here the “side windows were made
to open, as were two small windows at the back of the
cab.” For a short while, indeed, the private hansom
was one of the smartest of gentlemen’s carriages. Then
in 1889 was shown another hansom with a movable
hood. This was wholly unsuccessful, but the <i>Arlington
cab</i>, a Dorchester invention of this time, may still be
seen in provincial towns to which the taximeter petrol
cab has not yet reached. The chief peculiarity about
this hansom is its doors, which, instead of reaching only
half-way up and being constructed at a backward angle,
reach from door to roof and are upright&mdash;thus giving
a more spacious interior. These doors are “fitted with
sliding glasses in the top part after the manner of an
ordinary brougham door.” A <i>brougham hansom</i> was
introduced in 1887. “This afforded sitting-room inside
for three or four; it was entered at the back, and when
the door was shut, a seat across it was so arranged that
there was no possibility of the door opening till the
occupants’ weight was off the seat. The driver’s seat
was in front, on the roof of the vehicle.” A <i>four-wheeled
hansom</i> was also seen in London some twenty-five
years ago. Here the driver’s seat was behind the
carriage on a level with the roof.</p>

<p>“Everybody knows,” remarks Sir Walter Gilbey,
“that the hansom, by reason of its steadiness, is an
exceedingly comfortable conveyance; there is no vehicle
that runs more easily, particularly when the load is
truly balanced.” But in spite of such improvements as
rubber tyres and patent windows, the hansom seems
doomed.</p>

<p>Shillibeer’s huge omnibuses were succeeded by smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
vehicles of similar construction. For some years no
passengers were carried upon the roof except one or
two beside the driver. Then in 1849 an “outside seat
down the centre of the roof was added,” to reach which
you had to climb an iron ladder. This continued until
1890, when the much more convenient “garden-seats”
were substituted, and a curved flight of steps took the
place of the rather dangerous ladder. Private omnibuses
were first constructed about 1867. They contained
a rumble at the back for the footman, but this
was speedily dispensed with. As built to-day, they are
of various sizes.</p>

<p>One other carriage may be mentioned, and then I
am done. This is the <i>Irish car</i>. Here, as in the
larger <i>bian</i>, the seats are arranged back to back and
sideways. “The wheels are very low and are concealed
as far as the axle-boxes, or farther, by the panel of the
footboard, which panel is hinged to the end of the
<i>tray</i>, either side of which forms the seat, to allow of its
being turned up when not in use.” Occasionally there
is a well between the seats for small packages. In
private cars of this kind there is a small seat in front
for the driver, but this is rarely to be found in the
public vehicles. The width of the <i>Irish car</i> is enormous,
and occasionally leads the neophyte into trouble. Outside
Ireland, I believe, the car is not seen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Walking in the pleasant environs of Paris,” wrote
Mr. H. C. Marillier some seventeen years ago, in an
article entitled <i>The Automobile: A Forecast</i>, “or even
further afield, upon the broad <i>routes nationales</i> of
Charente and La Beauce, it is no uncommon thing to
meet on a summer’s day a little open vehicle flitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
along without apparent means of motion, upon noiseless
rubber-shod wheels, or panting forth a gentle warning
from a square-shaped box in front. Two, and
sometimes three, persons are seated in it, one of whom
drives by means of a handle. To stop or to start again
requires the turn of a screw or the push of a pedal.
Such, in its most accomplished and most graceful form,
is the <i>automobile</i>. To see it pass at racing speed&mdash;some
of these little machines can spurt at twenty miles an
hour&mdash;takes one’s breath away at first. The apparition
is uncanny.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In another passage he speaks of these horseless
carriages as playing “a prominent part as the natural
successors of the hansom cab and the omnibus,” and
draws what must then have been a fanciful picture of
a city upon whose roads there would be seen almost as
many horseless as horse-driven vehicles. To-day we
know what has happened since these words were
written. The hansom is a rarity, except during a strike
of petrol-car drivers. The omnibus is a speedy machine
with a powerful engine. The growler persists, but only
for the benefit of those with much luggage or for those
afraid of the internal combustion engine, that extraordinary
discovery which has revolutionised locomotion
even more than did steam eighty years ago. With
such facts as these it would be easy to prophesy a total
extinction of horse-driven vehicles except for purely
ornamental purposes. Yet I believe that there may be
a reaction in favour of a more leisurely means of locomotion.
As yet it is impossible to be truly dignified
in even the most gorgeously appointed motor-car.
“Carriage people” no longer form a class, and the old
coach-building firms which have not followed the times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and shown one or other make of automobile in their
rooms are few in number. Mr. Marillier, moreover,
in the article just quoted, speaks of “that ideal future
when life shall consist of sitting in a chair and pressing
buttons”; but the horse is not yet extinct, and although
it is not probable that any horse-carriages of an entirely
new type will be constructed, I imagine that the older
forms will persist, at any rate, for the next century or
two. Indeed, to my mind, there must always be the
man who will prefer the reins to the driving wheel.
And who can blame him for the choice?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Stratton treats of these Roman carriages and carts in considerable
detail, and mentions in addition to the <i>plostellum</i>, or small <i>plaustrum</i>, the
<i>carrus</i>, <i>monarchus</i>, and <i>birotum</i>. Of these the <i>carrus</i>, or cart, differed from
the <i>plaustrum</i> in the following particulars: “The box or form could not be
removed, as in the former case, but was fastened upon the axle-tree;
it lacked the broad flooring of planks or boards, which served as a
receptacle for certain commodities when the sides were removed;
the wheels were higher [and] ... spoked, not solid like the <i>tympana</i>.”
The <i>carrus clabularius</i>, or stave-waggon, could be lengthened or shortened
as required. The <i>monarchus</i> was a very light two-wheeled vehicle
something like the <i>cisium</i>. The <i>birotum</i> was also a small two-wheeled
vehicle, with a leather-covered seat, used in the time of Constantine, an
“early post-chaise,” as Stratton puts it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The carts of north Italy in the eighteenth century had remained
practically unchanged. Edward Wright, who visited Italy in 1719, thus
describes them: “The carriages in Lombardy, and indeed throughout all
Italy, are for the most part drawn with oxen; which are of a whitish
colour: they have very low wheels. Some I saw without spokes, solid
like mill-stones; such as I have seen describ’d in some antique basso-relievos
and Mosaicks. The pole they draw by is sloped upwards
towards the end; which is rais’d considerably above their heads; from
whence a chain, or rope, is let down and fasten’d to their horns; which
keeps up their heads, and serves to back the carriage. In some parts they
use no yokes, but draw all by the horn, by a sort of a brace brought about
the roots of them: the backs of the oxen are generally cover’d with a
cloth. In the kingdom of Naples, and some other parts, they use
buffaloes in their carriages, &amp;c. These do somewhat resemble oxen:
but are most sour, ill-looking animals, and very vicious; for the better
management of them they generally put rings in their noses.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> On the other hand, the scythes used by other nations may well have
been on the wheels. Livy describes those used by Antiochus (<i>currus
falcatus</i>): “Round the pole were sharp-pointed spears which extended
from the yoke of the two outside horses about fifteen feet; with these
they pierced everything in their way. On the end of the yoke were two
scythes, one being placed horizontally, the other towards the ground.
The first cut everything from the sides, the others catching those prostrate
on the ground or trying to crawl under. The long spears (<i>cuspides</i>) were
not on the yoke, as some say.”</p></div>

the city of Berlin, but from an Italian word <i>berlina</i>, “a name given
by the Italians to a kind of stage on which criminals are exposed to public
ignominy.” This seems rather far-fetched. In England it was always
thought to have been built first in Berlin, and was a common enough term
for a coach early in the eighteenth century. Swift mentions it in his
<i>Answer to a Scandalous Poem</i> (1733):&mdash;

<p>“It should be noted,” says Croal, “that we find the word differently
applied in the earlier years of the century, and in such a way as to cast
doubts on the derivations quoted. In some of the last Acts passed by the
Scottish Parliaments before the Union, there are references to a kind of
<i>ship</i> or boat, called a berline. The royal burghs on the west coast of
Scotland were in 1705 ordered to maintain two ‘berlines’ to prevent the
importation of ‘victual’ from Ireland, this importation being forbidden at
the time, and two years later an Act was passed to pay the expenses of the
berlines.”</p></div>

first used for the covering of the coach quarters, the heads of the nails
showed. But about 1660, “these nail-heads were covered with a strip of
metal made to imitate a row of beads; from this practice arose the name
of ‘beading’ which has been retained, although beading is now made in
a continuous, level piece, either rounded or angular.” <i>Thrupp.</i></p></div>

whence followed the gift of a French <i>calèche</i> which cost two thousand
livres. When the queen drove out in it, both the ladies agreed with
de Grammont that it afforded far better opportunities than a coach for
showing off their figures, and both endeavoured to get the first loan of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> It may be well to add here a note on the simpler springs which were
in use at this time. These seem to have been of five distinct varieties&mdash;the
straight or elbow spring, the elliptic spring, the regular-curved, and the
reverse-curved springs, all these being either single or double, and the
spiral spring. The straight spring was used in the stage-coaches, in the
later phaetons, in the Tilbury, and in most of the two-wheeled carriages.
The elliptic spring, invented by Elliott, was “used single in what are
called under-spring carriages, where the spring rests on the axle, and is
connected with the framework by means of a dumb or imitation spring so
as to form a double or complete ellipse. This is technically called an
under spring.” Its importance, of course, followed on its power of acting
as a complete support, no perch being required to hold the two parts of the
undercarriage together. Sometimes four of these springs were “hinged
together in pairs,” and used thus in the larger four-wheeled carriages.
When a regular-curved or C spring was used, “a leathern brace was suspended
from it to carry the body or weight.” The reverse-curved spring
was used in the older phaetons, and in the fore springs of the Tilbury, and
springs similar to this had been used as body springs in place of suspension
brackets or loops, or as upright springs, to the earlier coaches and chariots,
under the technical name of S springs&mdash;“in which case leather braces
were attached to them, and they were supported by a bracket or buttress
of iron called the spring stay. The whip spring which succeeded them
... was used in the same way.” But in addition to these springs,
there were all kinds of combinations, and the whole subject is too complicated
for the lay mind to understand. The chief point, however, to
notice is the changes in structure which were made possible by the elliptic
spring of Elliott’s resting on the axle.</p></div>

cab to be hired in London, if only you know where to look for
it. It is the only one of its kind, and rarely, I believe, appears until after

have drunk not wisely but too well.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> A good description is given of the appearance of these coaches by
Baron d’Haussez, an exiled Frenchman, in 1833.
</p>
<p>
“The appointments of an English coach are no less elegant than its
form. A portly, good-looking coachman seated on a very high coach-box,
well dressed, wearing white gloves, a nosegay in his button-hole, and
his chin enveloped in an enormous cravat, drives four horses perfectly
matched and harnessed, and as carefully groomed as when they excited
admiration in the carriages of Grosvenor and Berkeley Squares. Such
is the manner in which English horses are managed, such also is their
docility, the effect either of temperament or training, that you do not
remark the least restiveness in them. Four-horse coaches are to be seen
rapidly traversing the most populous streets of London, without occasioning
the least accident, without being at all inconvenienced in the midst of
the numerous carriages which hardly leave the necessary space to pass.
The swearing of ostlers is never heard at the relays any more than the
neighing of horses; nor are you interrupted on the road by the voice of
the coachman or the sound of his whip, which differs only from a
cabriolet whip in the length of the thong, and serves more as a sort of
appendage than a means of correction in the hand which carries it.”</p></div>

clear, the actual vehicle which proved so popular when plying
the streets contained very much more of Chapman’s work than of
Hansom’s, and, indeed, if full justice had been done, these light carriages
should have come down to posterity as <i>chapmans</i> and not <i>hansoms</i> at all. On
the other hand it is quite possible, that but for Hansom’s work, Chapman
would never have given such careful attention to this class of vehicle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Bridges Adams has an amusing passage on the question of colour.
He had his own ideas upon the best colours to use on a carriage body.
“For bright sunny days,” he thinks, “the straw or sulphur yellow is very
brilliant and beautiful; but for the autumnal haze, the rich deep orange
hue conveys the most agreeable sensations. The greens used are of
innumerable tints, commencing with the yellowish olive, and gradually
darkening till they are barely distinguishable from black. Neither apple
green, grass green, sea green, nor any green of a bluish tint, can be used
in carriage painting with good effect as a ground colour; but in some
species of light carriages a pleasing effect may be produced for summer by
the imitation of the variegated grasses.” Quite a poetical idea!
“Blues,” he continues, “were formerly principally used as a ground
colour for bodies, to contrast with a red carriage and framework. Of
late very dark blues have been used as a general ground colour, and when
new they are very rich, being a glazed or partially transparent colour; but
they very soon become worn and faded, the least speck of dust disfiguring
them. Blue is also a cold colour, and while it is unfitted for summer by
reason of its easy soiling, it is unpleasant in winter, owing to its want of
warmth.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> For full and particular accounts of all such carriages as have been
constructed since the middle of last century, the reader is referred to the
various trade journals. Further information is to be obtained from the
Reports on carriages at the successive London and Paris Exhibitions.

Austrian carriages are clearly shown in a language which is not too
technical for the ordinary reader to understand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> This was also the case in France.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> There is an interesting passage in the 1878 Report which may be
quoted here. “It is somewhat singular,” this runs, “that while the
attention of the English coachbuilders has, for the past few years, been
directed to perfect an arrangement to open and close landau heads in
a simple and effectual manner, the French builders have paid little or no
heed to the attainment of this desideratum, but have instead adopted
a plan which allows of the doors of a landau being opened when the
glass is up, being first introduced by M. Kellner ... in 1866....
The simplest method is to have two pieces of brass, about ten inches
long, in the form of a groove, for the glass frame to slide in, hinged to
the upper extremities of the door pillars, and to close down on the fence
rail when not required for use.”</p></div>

Exhibition in 1878 was shown a phaeton built at Rouen, which, according
to the official Report, was “the finest small carriage exhibited in the
French department for ingenuity and fitness for work.”</p></div>

<td class="tdj bl br bb padl1 padr1"><p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is now precisely two hundred and twenty-two years since Lord
Dundee fell mortally wounded at Killiecrankie, lamented by his
followers as the “last and best of Scots,” and cited by his most
inveterate opponents as the man upon whose life King James’s cause
depended. Few famous leaders have been more violently condemned by
partisan historians than the “Bluidy Claver’se” of Whig tradition, few
more fervently eulogised than the “Bonnie Dundee” of Jacobite romance
and song; but the time has now come when it is possible to form a dispassionate
and comprehensive estimate of a much-disputed character and
career. The book is valuable for its vivid picture of the Highland Campaign,
which (though constituting Dundee’s chief claim to immortality) has
hitherto been very inadequately treated by historians. In this latest and
most complete biography of Claverhouse, the requirements of the student,
the man of action, and the general public, have all been considered. The
illustrations form an attractive feature and include amongst others the
famous Glamis and Melville portraits of the “Persecutor,” a facsimile of
one of his letters to Lord Queensberry, and a beautiful, but little-known,
contemporary pencil drawing, which in its delicacy of execution rivals the
art of the miniature painter. New and excellent military maps (bearing
the imprint of Mr. Edward Stanford), an itinerary of the Highland Campaign
and a copious bibliography, much enhance the practical utility of
Mr. Barrington’s work.</p>

<p>Especial care has been devoted to the production of the book, and its
appearance will be found to please the most critical. The paper used is
an Antique Laid, specially manufactured for the volume. The edition is
limited to 900 copies for sale in England and America, and in addition to
these there is an Edition de Luxe, strictly limited to 50 copies, each one
numbered and signed by the Author. The ordinary edition is bound in
brown buckram, with a cover design embodying the arms of Claverhouse
reproduced in gilt; the Edition de Luxe is bound in full vellum, and the
photogravures are specially printed on India paper. The price of the
latter is Three Guineas net, and only a small number remain.</p></td>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
